This includes the provision of data to the RBGE online catalogues as well as providing data to numerous external data partners I map the Living Collections of the RBGE, across all four of its sites and I am developing tools for the RBGE staff to use this data.  I am interested in how technology can be used to improve the visitor experience to RBGE, and how it can improve productivity in the horticultural department. I also work on information workflows within the RBGE herbarium, particularly how software and hardware can help make the information held within the 3 million herbarium sheets more accessible.

    _Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility, Taipei, Taiwan._ Daphne has been trained as a marine biologist since completing her BSc and PhD studies. Her PhD research focused on fungal infection in sea turtle eggs, encompassing various aspects including analyzing pathogen genomics and assessing pathogenicity using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches. She co-founded TurtleSpot Taiwan - a citizen science project dedicated to collecting sea turtle sightings for research. Recognizing the potential for generating large volumes of primary biodiversity data through her research, she became intrigued by Biodiversity Informatics and actively engaged herself in this field. She currently works as a postdoctoral researcher at the Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), focusing on evaluating national-level biodiversity data gaps.
