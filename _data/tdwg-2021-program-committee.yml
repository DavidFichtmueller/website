    _University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States; Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, United States._ Kimberly is a Ph.D. student at the University of Kentucky studying biogeography. Informed by her background in biology and library science, she seeks to combine life history and environmental data to understand spatiotemporal patterns in biodiversity. Using this methodology, her ultimate goal is to build better relationships between academia and conservation practitioners for a more environmentally resilient future. Newly active in the TDWG community, Kimberly is eager to find new ways to think about biodiversity data and the people who generate it.
