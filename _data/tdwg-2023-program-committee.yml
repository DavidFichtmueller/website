    _Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility, Taipei, Taiwan._ Daphne has been trained as a marine biologist since completing her BSc and PhD studies. Her PhD research focused on fungal infection in sea turtle eggs, encompassing various aspects including analyzing pathogen genomics and assessing pathogenicity using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches. She co-founded TurtleSpot Taiwan - a citizen science project dedicated to collecting sea turtle sightings for research. Recognizing the potential for generating large volumes of primary biodiversity data through her research, she became intrigued by Biodiversity Informatics and actively engaged herself in this field. She currently works as a postdoctoral researcher at the Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), focusing on evaluating national-level biodiversity data gaps.

    _Information Science and BioFrontiers Institute, University of Colorado Boulder, USA._ Kit is an interdisciplinary PhD student studying HCI (Human Computer Interaction) and IQ Bio (Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology). She is also a member of the TAG (Technical Architecture Group) since 2022 where she works on projects related to standards and their lifecycle. For her HCI research, she focuses on how information overload impacts institutions grounded in big data (specifically looking at natural history and biocollections) mainly employing ethnographic(traditional + digital) and network science methods advised by Stephen Voida. Under the guidance of Orit Peleg in the BioFrontiers Institute, she studies North American firefly biodiversity, flash signals, and complex system science. She bridges her two interests through complex systems research, information ecosystem modeling, and biologically inspired information theory.
