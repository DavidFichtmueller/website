TDWG Interest (IG) and Task (TG) Groups undertake the core business of our organization: developing the standards and guidelines that enable us to integrate vast amounts of biodiversity information. TDWG is committed to supporting its Interest and Task Groups by contributing to the costs of conducting working meetings. Support will be provided through a fund dedicated to this purpose, the TDWG Community Support Fund (CSF). The size of the Fund will be adjusted yearly by decision of the TDWG Executive Committee. This year the amount will be $6,000 (USD). The deadline for applications this year is April 10th, 2017. [Learn more](http://www.tdwg.org/activities/comm-support-fund/).
