TDWG is an international organization that promotes the digitization, integration, and sharing of information about the world’s biodiversity. TDWG provides a forum where individuals, projects, and institutions who manage biodiversity data can come together to share expertise and promote interoperability by promulgating standards and best practices. In 2018, TDWG launched the Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS) journal where papers on issues related to information technology and biodiversity science can be published. The TDWG Executive Committee oversees the work of TDWG: it coordinates TDWG Interest and Task Groups, manages the review and ratification of standards, manages the organization’s journal, and organizes the annual meeting. These responsibilities are set forth in the Constitution and detailed further in a supplementary document. 

Positions on the Executive are staggered two-year terms, such that no more than half of the committee will be new in any year. Towards the end of every calendar year, TDWG holds elections for terms that are expiring and need to be filled for the coming year. Officers elected this year will serve terms from 2020 through 2021. The open positions and their responsibilities are detailed below, followed by the schedule and procedures for nominations and the election.

## General responsibilities

All officers, including Subcommittee Chairs, have voting rights on the Executive Committee, and are expected to participate in the committee’s conference calls, which may be monthly, bi-weekly or ad-hoc. Executive Committee members are expected to find their own support to attend the annual conference.

## Offices open for election

### Treasurer

The Treasurer maintains the accounts of TDWG; files financial documents as required by governments where TDWG is registered; and administers the assets of TDWG in conformance with instructions from the Executive Committee. The Treasurer reports finances annually to the Executive Committee and membership; collects membership dues and other TDWG income; maintains the membership list; and is entitled to sign jointly with one other officer on behalf of TDWG.  

### Technical Architecture Group, Chair

The purpose of the Technical Architecture Group (TAG) is to guide ongoing development of the TDWG technical architecture and advise the Executive and membership on matters relating to the principles, strategies and practice for maintaining the common technical framework essential to TDWG's mission to develop, adopt and promote standards and practice for the recording and exchange of biodiversity data.  The Chair of this Subcommittee appoints the members and manages their work. More details about this Subcommittee and the role of the Chair can be found in the [Group's charter](/about/committees/tag/). 

### Functional Subcommittee for Infrastructure, Chair

TDWG depends upon an information technology and communications infrastructure to achieve its purposes. This infrastructure includes hardware systems, software, and IT services. The Chair of the Infrastructure Subcommittee is responsible for organizing and executing the activities of the Subcommittee to support TDWG. More details about this role can be found in the [Subcommittee's charter](/about/committees/infrastructure/).

### Functional Subcommittee for Time and Place, Chair

The purpose of the Time and Place Functional Subcommittee is to establish a six year rolling plan for the hosting of TDWG meetings, which seeks to expand the influence of TDWG whilst retaining and increasing its core membership base. It is aiming at expanding the TDWG community, maintaining existing community, maintaining functionality of Interest and Task Groups, and taking advantage of funding for hosting opportunities. ([More details](/about/committees/tardis/)).

### Regional Representatives: Latin America, Oceania

Regional Representatives give voice to the members, institutions, and projects in their region, and collectively provide a global perspective to the Executive Committee. As members of the Executive Committee, Regional Representatives have responsibility for the oversight of TDWG and the authority to approve/decline strategic initiatives, budgets, and all aspects of operations and activities. The Executive Committee also approves or declines the formation of Interest and Task Groups, as well as the ratification of standards and best practice specifications produced by Interest and Task Groups.

## Nomination procedure

To nominate someone for one of the positions above, first confirm that the nominee is willing to accept the responsibilities of the office. Then work with the nominee to send a brief statement of the nominee’s background and vision (maximum 400 words) to the TDWG Secretary (<secretary@tdwg.org>). Self nominations are accepted. All nominations must be complete and received before 10 Nov, 2019 (extended from 1 Nov).

## Election procedure
