The Audubon Core Maintenance Group seeks public comment on a set of proposed term additions and changes designed to enable the designation of Regions of Interest (ROIs) within media items. These regions are defined using dimensions of space, time, and frequency and enable users to refer to particular parts of the media resource that are associated with occurrences of individual organisms. 

This proposal has been developed by the Maintenance Group through a series of meetings over the past year that examined existing approaches and solicited input from the community. The Maintenance Group now considers the proposal mature enough to move into the public review phase as described in [section 3.3 of the Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](http://rs.tdwg.org/vms/doc/specification/#33-changes-to-vocabulary-terms). 

To see the proposed changes, view the four issues at <https://github.com/tdwg/ac/milestone/4>. The preferred method for commenting is to add a comment to a particular issue in the GitHub tracker. If you have problems using the GitHub system, you can also email comments to the convener at <steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu> and he will paste them into the tracker. If you would like to indicate support, you can state it in a comment or use the “thumbs up” reaction.

The public comment period will commence on 23 June 2021 and will end on 23 July or 30 days after consensus is reached. Please share this announcement on your networks so that we can reach as large an audience as possible.
