Between 20th and 24th September 2021, representatives of the [14 institutions](https://bicikl-project.eu/partners) partnering in the BiCIKL project teamed up in a hybrid hackathon, held simultaneously at the Meise Botanic Garden (Belgium) and on Zoom. 

Nine research projects have been proposed:

**Project 1**: Finding the losts parents

**Project 2**: How good are triple IDs in ENA?

**Project 3**: Enhancing the GBIF clustering algorithms

**Project 4**: Assigning Latin scientific names to operational taxonomic units based on sequence clusters

**Project 5**: Registering biodiversity-related vocabulary as Wikidata lexemes and link their meaning to Wikidata items

**Project 6**: FAIR Digital Object design from multiple sources

**Project 7**: Enriching Wikidata with information from OpenBiodiv about type specimens in context from different literature sources

**Project 8**: Linking specimen with material citation and vice versa

**Project 9**: Hidden women in science

Members of TDWG executive committee took part into projects 3, 6 and 9 and in the general discussions on day 1 and 5.
