# Organize a session at TDWG 2022

<H2><em>17â€“21 October 2022</em></H2>

The Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) annual conference in 2022 will be a hybrid meeting, hosted in Sofia, Bulgaria by:

- Pensoft Publishers
- National Museum of Natural History, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences
- Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences

Essential early information has been posted on the [conference website](/conferences/2022/). Additional information will be posted as it becomes available.

We invite you to [submit a proposal](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CYK8HPR) for an organized session at TDWG 2022. The topic can be anything appropriate for TDWG, but priority will be given to proposals that address the conference theme, "Stronger Together: Standards for linking biodiversity data." Organized sessions can take the form of a symposium, panel discussion, or another format in which the primary purpose is to convey information and engage the audience. Session proposers will be responsible for soliciting and coordinating presentations, reviewing and approving abstracts, and moderating their proposed session(s). We recommend at least one session organizer should be present at the in-person meeting if possible. Every presentation listed in the program must have an abstract, which will be published in our open access journal, [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards](https://biss.pensoft.net/), as part of TDWG Proceedings 2022 (see past [Proceedings](https://biss.pensoft.net/collections)). Presenters must be registered for the conference.

If your proposal is accepted, your session title and description will be posted (subject to editing for clarity and length) on the [TDWG 2022 conference website](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2022/).

Submission (hard) deadline: **15 April 2022**

Please contact the [conference organizers](mailto:conf-organizers@tdwg.org) with any questions.

We look forward to seeing your session ideas (by the 15th April!)!
