# Our partner BiCIKL needs your help!

BiCIKL is an EU project that aims to provide access and tools for seamless linking between the data along the biodiversity research cycle: specimens > sequences > species > analytics > publications > biodiversity knowledge graph > re-use.  BiCIKL will develop and implement new methods and workflows for integrated access to harvesting, liberating, linking, accessing and re-using of sub-article-level data (specimens, material citations, samples, sequences, taxonomic names, taxonomic treatments, figures, tables) extracted from literature.

For doing so, we would like to know you better. This is why we ask you things!

This [questionnaire](https://forms.lifewatch.eu/virtualoffice433/form/BiCIKLuserrequirementsanalysis/formperma/WvPzL2iXD5ZyRqybAF960fwfp9Us2bNZ_iJFD0vSnlM) prepared by [LifeWatch](https://www.lifewatch.eu/), aims to identify gaps and trends in the ways in which biodiversity scientists access and use data in their research, by asking participants to describe use cases from their previous or projected work experience. The most appealing use cases will be invited to the open call for Trans-national access projects supported by the BiCIKL project.
