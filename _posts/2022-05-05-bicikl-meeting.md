The fourteen partners of the [BiCIKL project](https://bicikl-project.eu/) met in Seville (Spain) for their first physical meeting at the beginning of May, one year after the start of the project, whose mission is to catalyse a top-down culture change in the way researchers work with data about the worldâ€™s biodiversity at each step of the research process. TDWG was well represented by 4 members of the Executive committee!
