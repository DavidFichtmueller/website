[![BiCIKL Logo](https://static.tdwg.org/sponsors/bicikl_logo_full_mixed_on-black_w600.png)](https://bicikl-project.eu)

The [BiCIKL project](https://bicikl-project.eu/) invites submissions of Expression of Interest (EoI) to the First BiCIKL Open Call for projects. The purpose of this call is to solicit, select and implement four to six biodiversity data-related scientific projects that will make use of the added value services developed by the leading [Research Infrastructures](https://bicikl-project.eu/research-infrastructures) that make the BiCIKL project.  

The BiCIKL project establishes a European starting community of key research infrastructures, researchers, citizen scientists and other biodiversity and life sciences stakeholders based on open science practices through access to data, tools and services.
