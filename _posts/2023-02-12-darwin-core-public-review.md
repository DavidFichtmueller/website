Celebrating Darwin Day, the members of the Darwin Core Maintenance Group are happy to announce the opening of a minimum 30-day period for public review for the set of proposed changes to Darwin Core.

Please refer to the documentation we have provided on the review process and the maintenance of the Darwin Core standard in general at <https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/wiki/Darwin-Core-Maintenance-Frequently-Asked-Questions>.

For your reference and convenience we are providing a table with links to the proposed changes, organized in keeping with the order in the Darwin Core Quick Reference Guide (<https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/>). The relevant issues are also listed in the following milestone: <https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/milestone/16>.

Your comments are welcome and important for the evolution of the Darwin Core standard.

Thank you

The Darwin Core Maintenance Team
