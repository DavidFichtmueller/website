On the 27th of October 2022, Constance A. "Connie" Rinaldo died after a rapid and sudden illness. Connie was the immediate past chair of the Executive Committee of the Biodiversity Heritage Library [BHL](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) and Connie was also TDWG's last chair of the [Partnerships and Fundraising subcommittee](https://www.tdwg.org/about/committees/fundraising/).
TDWG, represented by Visotheary Ung, was lucky to participate in a celebration to honour her life on the 19th of April during the 2023 BHL Annual Meeting, in Paris.
