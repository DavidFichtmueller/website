Our partner BiCIKL (Biodiversity Community Integrated Knowledge Library) will support free-of-charge publications* submitted to the dedicated topical collection: [“Linking FAIR biodiversity data through publications: The BiCIKL approach”](https://bdj.pensoft.net/topical_collection/209/) in the [Biodiversity Data Journal](https://bdj.pensoft.net/), demonstrating advanced publishing methods of linked biodiversity data, so that they can be easily harvested, distributed and re-used to generate new knowledge. 

As you know, BiCIKL is dedicated to building a new community of key research infrastructures, researchers and citizen scientists by using linked FAIR biodiversity data at all stages of the research lifecycle, from specimens through sequencing, imaging, identification of taxa, etc. to final publication in novel, re-usable, human-readable and machine-interpretable scholarly articles.

Achieving a culture change in how biodiversity data are being identified, linked, integrated and re-used is the mission of the BiCIKL consortium. By doing so, BiCIKL is to help increase the transparency, trustworthiness and efficiency of the entire research ecosystem.
