## Your Slides, Your Story, Your Attitude: Make your presentations work

**Presented by:** Jos√© Alonso, Deborah Paul, & Mareike Petersen

Presentations are a key element in sharing your knowledge with others. The plotting of your narrative and how it is presented can make or break the relationship with your audience. In this one hour seminar session of TDWG's Functional Subcommittee on Outreach and Communication, we would like to pass along some tips for making your presentations more engaging and provide a space to exchange sources on how to enhance personal skills to convey your message.

**Date & Time:** 15 June 4:30 PM CEST / 2:30 PM UTC or find your time [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=TDWG+Webinar%3A+Your+Slides%2C+Your+Story%2C+Your+Attitude%3A+Make+your+presentations+work&iso=20230615T1430&p1=1440)
