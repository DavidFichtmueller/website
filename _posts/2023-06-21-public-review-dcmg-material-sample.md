The members of the Darwin Core Maintenance Group are happy to announce the opening of a minimum 30-day period for public review for a set of proposed changes to Darwin Core coming out of research and discussions in the [Material Sample Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/material-sample/), ably led by Teresa Mayfield-Meyer over the past two years. 

The public review discussion is happening here: [https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/milestone/18](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/milestone/18). You may find context for the proposal and discussion in the [New Term - dwc:MaterialEntity](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues/426) (the last proposal in milestone 18). 

Please also refer to the documentation we have provided on the review process and the maintenance of the Darwin Core standard in general at [https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/wiki/Darwin-Core-Maintenance-Frequently-Asked-Questions](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/wiki/Darwin-Core-Maintenance-Frequently-Asked-Questions).

For your reference and convenience we provide a table (below) with links to the proposed changes listed in [milestone 18](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/milestone/18), organized in keeping with the order in the [Darwin Core Quick Reference Guide](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/). 

We welcome your comments. Your participation is important for the evolution of the [Darwin Core standard](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/).

Thank you,

The Darwin Core Material Sample Task Group

The Darwin Core Maintenance Team
