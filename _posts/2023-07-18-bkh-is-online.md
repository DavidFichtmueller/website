We are happy to announce that our partner [BiCIKL](https://bicikl-project.eu/) has launched the [Biodiversity Knowledge Hub (BKH)](https://biodiversityknowledgehub.eu/)!

BKH is a one-stop portal that allows users to access FAIR and interlinked biodiversity data and services in a few clicks. BKH has been designed to support a newly emerging community of users over time and across the entire biodiversity research cycle providing its services to anybody, anywhere and anytime.
The BiCIKL project establishes a European starting community of key research infrastructures, researchers, citizen scientists and other biodiversity and life sciences stakeholders based on open science practices through access to data, tools and services.
