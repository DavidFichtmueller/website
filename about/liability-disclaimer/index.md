## COVID-19 and in-person events

The novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, has been declared a worldwide pandemic. COVID-19 is extremely contagious, with the virus primarily spread through the air. People can be infected and show no symptoms yet still spread the disease. COVID-19 can cause serious illness and death. Neither Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) nor the local hosts of its annual conference can prevent you from becoming exposed to, contracting, or spreading COVID-19 while attending their conference, participating in a TDWG event or activity, or performing any action for or on behalf of TDWG or its representatives. Any in-person interaction with, at, or for TDWG may increase the risk of contracting or spreading COVID-19. Individuals who have not been vaccinated remain at greater risk of infection and potentially serious complications from contracting the virus, and risks exist even for individuals who have been fully vaccinated, boosted, or even contracted an earlier variant of the virus.

## Participant responsibility

I agree and understand these specific risks and nonetheless accept them in order to utilize TDWG's services and attend an event or activity. These services are of such value to me that I accept the risk of being exposed to, contracting, and/or spreading COVID-19 in order to participate in person rather than participating virtually or not participating at all. I further hereby forever release and waive all claims and rights against TDWG, its members, local organizers and hosts of TDWG activities in connection with exposure, infection, and/or spread of COVID-19 related to utilizing its services or the conference venue or interacting with other members. I understand that this release and waiver means I give up my right to bring any claims including for personal injuries, death, disease, property losses, or any other loss that may be released and waived under applicable law, including, but not limited to, claims of negligence, and I understand that this release and waiver prevents me from seeking damages in any way against TDWG, whether such damages are known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, or that occur now or in the future.
