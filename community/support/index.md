## What is the TDWG Community Support Fund?

TDWG [Interest (IG) and Task (TG) Groups](/community/#interest-group) are the organizational entities that undertake standards development and maintenance. Every year, if the budget permits, TDWG supports the work of IG/TGs by contributing to the costs of convening one or two working meetings.

## What does the TDWG CSF cover?

1. Travel and subsistence support for participation in IG/TG working meetings.
1. Costs directly related to the organization of IG/TG working meetings, including venue hire.
1. Costs related to the dissemination of the workshop/meeting results and engagement of stakeholders.

## Who can apply?

TDWG IG/TG conveners may apply for funds to (co-)organize IG/TG working meetings.

Please be aware that proposals from Groups that have a current annual report will be given preference. A [guide to reporting](../management/guide-to-reporting) and a template for IG/TG annual reports (as [GoogleDoc](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1VYHouWmgh94zUibFgDlTW_6cwCTsYbl6Kq9vsczFPjA) or in [Markdown](../management/annual-report-template/). (See [Responsibilities of conveners](../management) for a more comprehensive enumeration of responsibilities.)  

## Call frequency
