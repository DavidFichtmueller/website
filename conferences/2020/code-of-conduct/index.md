# Code of Conduct for _TDWG 2020_

TDWG 2020 will be meeting virtually 21–25 September and 19–23 October. **_By participating in any event during or associated with TDWG 2020, you agree voluntarily to abide by this Code of Conduct._** 

## Expectations:

Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) is dedicated to providing a safe, hospitable, and productive environment for everyone participating in this conference, regardless of ethnicity, religion, professional status, disability, physical appearance, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation. It is important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is neither healthy nor productive. We ask that all participants make every effort to maintain constructive and civil discourse with other attendees at all times. This includes speakers honoring designated time limits, attendees being aware of balancing speaking and listening time, and especially welcoming attendees that are new to our community or early in their careers.

## Harassment and Safety: 

Accordingly, the conference organizers prohibit intimidating, threatening, or harassing conduct during this conference. This policy applies to presenters, volunteers, and attendees. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without warning or refund, at the discretion of leadership.

**To file a complaint or report an issue.** If you are being harassed, would like to file a complaint, or have other concerns about the safety of participants, please do not hesitate to contact the Conference Organizers at [conf-organizers@tdwg.org](mailto:conf-organizers@tdwg.org).

## Additional Considerations:

**Authors and Presenters** should conform to the highest standards of scientific attribution and citation in their abstracts and presentations. All authors connected to a presentation and its associated abstract must be aware of and agree with the information presented. Obtaining consent from all authors associated with the presentation is the responsibility of the lead author. The presenter of a submitted abstract must have intention of registering, attending, and participating in the meeting once the submission is accepted into the program. 

<span style="text-decoration: line-through">Please respect the presenter's "no sharing" (crossed out Twitter logo) on slides or posters.</span>

Because TDWG's mission is to reach as broad an audience as possible, abstracts are published, and presentations (audio/video, slides, and posters) may be streamed, recorded, and made publically available. TDWG reserves the right to use photographs and videos taken and testimonials given during this event or in subsequent meeting surveys for informational and promotional purposes.
