We are pleased to announce the call for abstracts for [TDWG 2021](/conferences/2021/), the virtual conference of [Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)](/), which will be held 18â€“22 October 2021. Abstracts will be submitted to and published in [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)](https://biss.pensoft.net/). **The deadline has been extended to 20 August for submission of abstracts for posters only. The deadline for the submission of other abstract types was 2 August 2021.** Abstracts will be peer reviewed and final approval for publication requires payment of any registration fees by the presenter. Content may be presented either live or pre-recorded for TDWG 2021. Sessions will be recorded and made available initially only to registered attendees.
