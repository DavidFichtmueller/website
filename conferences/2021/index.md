## Connecting the world of biodiversity data: standards uniting people, processes, and tools

As we continue to connect people and biodiversity data globally by virtual means in these globally uncertain times, TDWG 2021 will be composed of symposia, workshops, contributed oral and poster presentations, demos, and discussions, as well as keynotes and social events. **#tdwg2021**

## Working Sessions

Working sessions of the TDWG Interest Groups, Task groups, and Functional Subcommittees will be held separately in November 2021.

See [working session details and logistics](/conferences/2021/working-sessions/).

## Hosts

TDWG 2021 will be hosted on the virtual platform, [Whova](https://whova.com), by the [University of Florida Biodiversity Institute](https://biodiversity.research.ufl.edu/) with Director [Dr. Pam Soltis](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/soltis-lab/) at the University of Florida, Gainesville, along with the [Florida Museum of Natural History](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/) and [iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org/). The University of Florida Conference Services group, led by Avery Bender will be managing registration, and our use of the Conference virtual platform.

## Registration

While virtual, connecting and uniting the TDWG community for the sharing of standards, processes and tools, does not come free. This year's modest registration fee includes a discount structure, and helps to defray the cost of abstract publication. **Registration is now closed.** Special discounts were in place for students, post-docs, and participants from developing nations. If the cost of registration is a barrier to your participation in this conference, please contact <conf-organizers@tdwg.org> and briefly state why this is a barrier. Individual TDWG members and up to five representatives from [member institutions](https://www.tdwg.org/about/membership/#institutional%20members%202021_1) enjoy a $25 discount for regular registration. Not yet a member? [Become an individual member](https://zohosecurepay.com/checkout/wc9vqum-8am1lyxy1fswt/Individual-TDWG-Membership) before registering for TDWG 2021.

## Abstracts

Abstracts are required for all contributions (oral presentations and virtual posters) and are being published in our open access journal, [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards](https://biss.pensoft.net/) as [TDWG Proceedings 2021](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/293/). Presenters are required to complete registration before abstracts can be published. 

The [call for abstracts](/conferences/2021/call-for-abstracts/) was released 6 June with a deadline of 2 August. This deadline was extended to 20 August for posters only. The deadline for submission of abstracts has now closed. **See published abstracts in [TDWG Proceedings 2021](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/293/).**

## Schedule

The latest schedule (v4.1 10 October) has been posted as a Google spreadsheet. See the [TDWG 2021 October Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17J5T0QdATdnrXgHWhguMErlSrfMo59qOCbss-R5whEU/edit?usp=sharing) overview (first tab, see the [session list](/conferences/2021/session-list/) for descriptions of each session) and detailed schedule with speakers and times (second tab). Three time zones are listed for *start times* of each session or presentation, the middle one, [EDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20211018T110000&p1=1440&p2=tz_et&p3=tz_aet) is that of our hosts at the University of Florida. Time zone differences across our global community make it unavoidable that some sessions of interest may occur well outside of normal working hours or during the middle of the night for some; recorded sessions will be posted in a timely fashion on the platform for on-demand viewing.
