# Presentation Expectations

_Translations: [ES](https://tdwg.org/conferences/2021/es/info-de-presentaciones/)_

During the virtual conference week, sessions were scheduled during the time zone of our host ([1100â€“2300 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=TDWG+2021&iso=20211018T11&p1=1440&ah=12)), with most sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, plus a break between sessions (see latest schedule [overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17J5T0QdATdnrXgHWhguMErlSrfMo59qOCbss-R5whEU/edit#gid=1817747157) and [detail](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17J5T0QdATdnrXgHWhguMErlSrfMo59qOCbss-R5whEU/edit#gid=1453000815). On Thursday and Friday of the conference week, two interactive events will be held in parallel to the main session. Our hosts at the University of Florida will be communicating with presenters and arranging training sessions on the Whova conference platform. Please plan to attend one or more training session.

## Resources for presenters and moderators

**TDWG 2021 Slide Template**
Paula Zermoglio has designed a [TDWG 2021 Google Slide template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PeRjF2ZVXKkCl7zMYMMUnlErl7ZlM-gZx4LsmLFZJoE/edit?usp=sharing) (make a copy or download as PowerPoint file to use), which may optionally be used by anyone presenting at TDWG 2021.

## Contributed Oral Presentations
Contributed Oral Presentations are 10 minutes to present + 3 min. for questions + 2 min. to change presenters (total 15 min/presentation) with speakers divided into three sessions. It is expected that most presentations will be live (and recorded by the hosts for later on-demand viewing in the Whova conference platform), but some may be pre-recorded by presenters because of time zone or other issues. Details will be handled in a separate communication.

Each presentation features a published abstract, which may be found [here](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/294/). 

## Symposia
Symposia generally use the same 15 minute format as Contributed Oral presentations (10 min talks + 3 min for questions + 2 min transition to next speaker). Symposia may include time set aside for an introduction and a discussion. As with Contributed Oral, it is expected that most presentations will be live (and recorded for later on-demand viewing), but some may be pre-recorded by presenters because of time zone or other issues. Details will be handled in a separate communication.

Each presentation features a published abstract found [here](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/293/). The list of symposium organizers and descriptions are [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2021/session-list/](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2021/session-list/).

## Workshops, panel discussions, & unconference
Workshops, the panel discussion, and the unconference will include introductions to set the stage for each session. These will be recorded, but any breakout parts of the working sessions will not. While we encourage the submission of at least one abstract to represent each session, organizers may arrange to submit an abstract summarizing outcomes (post-conference), or to submit a longer, post-conference article (cost not included as part of registration) to the [TDWG 2021 Proceedings](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/293/).

## Posters
Each poster features a [published abstract](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/295/). While there is a time reserved on Thursday for poster presenters to be present in the PostersPlus area of Whova (conference platform), **posters are available for viewing, comments, and questions throughout the conference and should be uploaded to the conference platform by 15 October** (instructions and links provided separately to each presenter).  

Presenters are encouraged to reimagine what their virtual posters could be while still keeping with the spirit of an entity that is self-contained and self-explanatory, emphasizing fewer words and more graphical flow of ideas. We encourage you to think beyond the "scientific paper as a poster" mode to combine science, art, and storytelling (e.g. [https://theoatmeal.com/comics/wombats](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/wombats)). 

Posters should be uploaded as PDF files. Presenters may also link a short video (<3 min) about their posters (instructions for uploading these to a private space on TDWG's YouTube channel will be provided separately). See also [Instructions for Posters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4t_iG59HeaD3m-6O0J5NCKZNLQUuI0XfOjBmZViNSc/edit?usp=sharing).
