# TDWG November 2021, Working Sessions 

_Last updated 22 October 2021_


TDWG will host working sessions of the Interest and Task Groups (IG/TG) each Wednesday and Thursday in November. These sessions will be hosted in Zoom by TDWG and be free but require registration.


Working sessions will include introductions, overviews of IG/TG use cases, solutions, collaboration resources, and current work practices. The sessions will be interactive, with the participants being able to see each other and raise hands to interact with the conveners, speakers and other participants. 


Below you can find the list of sessions, including workshops on a specific subject and meetings of the respective Interest Groups and Task Groups (ITG) and Functional Groups (FG) to progress on their activities and planning.


# Schedule
The latest schedule (21 Oct.) has been posted as a Google spreadsheet. See the [TDWG 2021 November Working Sessions Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uffjh1SAXvSi_si53ljCbAsfqRUSvqzB8DnUHV-UV3A/edit?usp=sharing). Three time zones are listed for start times of each session. Time zone differences across our global community make it unavoidable that some sessions of interest may occur well outside of normal working hours or during the middle of the night for some.

Check back for more repeated sessions to be added soon. Each session will be recorded and made available for later viewing. Session organizers are encouraged to use shared notes to enable asynchronous participation. Links will be added to the descriptions below after the live session. 

# Registration and how to support the conference
[Registration is available through Eventbrite](https://tdwg-2021-working-sessions.eventbrite.com). Registration is required to participate in the online events (so we can arrange sufficient capacity), but registration is free.

## WS03: Hands-on session on standardization of biological interactions data
**Date/Time:** November 10, 14:00 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=WS03%3A+Hands-on+session+on+standardization+of+biological+interactions+data&iso=20211110T14))

**Session Type:** Workshop

**Organizers:** [José Augusto Salim](mailto:joseasalim@usp.br), University of São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil | Maarten Trekels, Meise Botanic Garden, Meise, Belgium

**Description:** Primary data about biological interactions (e.g. predator-prey, host-parasite, pollinator-plant, frugivore-plant) are becoming increasingly available online and can be accessed from a great number of data repositories. However, the lack of a formal standard to support biological interaction data sharing and interoperability, makes data aggregation a laborious task and therefore it has hampered the development of wider, more integrative studies.  Even the terminology itself is not well established. Different terms have been used to designate different or same concepts related to biological interactions. Terms like "species interaction", "biotic interaction", "ecological interaction", "interspecific interaction" and "biological interaction" are frequently used interchangeably in the literature.    Despite the variety of methods to collect, record and store biological interaction data, there is a great need and interest in making these datasets comparable and interoperable, considering the importance of understanding such processes' role in sustaining biodiversity. Thus, the aim of this hands-on session is to gather people with different views and expertise on how biological interactions data can be organized and which are the most relevant elements for sharing biological interactions data - probably, there is a minimum set of attributes and properties common to all or most interaction data use cases. The hands-on session will be a practical exercise to guide participants on how to document biological interaction data using current biodiversity data standards (e.g., Darwin Core), and will promote discussions among the participants for the development of a best practice guide for documenting biological interactions.    Since there are many different use cases and due to time constraints, during the session we will cover a subset of use cases proposed by the participants and all the session's activities will be focused on the selected use cases. We will evaluate the suggested use cases and select a subset based on the demand, complexity and diversity. The objective is to cover the most common and yet different - in terms of type of interaction - use cases that fits the session duration. However, we will create discussion on the TDWG Species Interaction Data Interest Group GitHub repository for all use cases (including the use cases not selected to be handled during the session). In the discussions we will encourage people to provide examples of interaction data and collaboratively elaborate a standardized version of the working datasets.


## WS04: People in Biodiversity Data: Sharing the Disambiguation Work
**Date/Time:** November 17, 20:00 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=WS04%3A+People+in+Biodiversity+Data%3A+Sharing+the+Disambiguation+Work&iso=20211117T20))

**Session Type:** Workshop

**Organizers:** [David P. Shorthouse](mailto:davidpshorthouse@gamil.com), Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada | Quentin Groom, Meise Botanical Garden, Meise, Belgium | Elspeth Haston, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland | Anne Thessen, Oregon State University, Oregon, USA

**Description:** 
The People in Biodiversity Task Group within the Joint Research Data Alliance - TDWG Attribution Interest Group has a Charter with twelve deliverables, [https://www.tdwg.org/community/attribution/](https://www.tdwg.org/community/attribution/) all of which are nearing completion. We will provide an update of our accomplishments and will also look to the future. One of the goals of Task Group and that of the Interest Group is to democratize the activities of disambiguating people names and attributing data objects and products to reconciled identities. We will use this workshop to discuss and provide examples of how these linkages may participate in open, curatorial round trips to data providers and aggregators and to highlight the role that newly ratified Darwin Core terms, identifiedByID and recordedByID play in this emerging ecosystem.

**Repeated Session (ITG01-R):** November 10, 23:00 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ITG01-R%3A+Earth+Sciences+and+Paleobiology+Interest+Group&iso=20211110T23))

## ITG02: Taxon Names and Concepts Interest Group (TNC)
**Date/Time:** November 4, 21:00 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ITG02%3A+Taxon+Names+and+Concepts+Interest+Group+%28TNC%29&iso=20211104T21))

**Session Type:** Interest/Task Group meeting

**Organizers:** [Niels Klazenga](mailto:Niels.Klazenga@rbg.vic.gov.au), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria/Atlas of Living Australia, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia | Johan Liljeblad, SLU Swedish Species Information Centre, Uppsala, Sweden

**Description:** This year a TCS 2 Task Group was established whose job is to bring the Taxon Concept Schema (TCS) into a state in which it can be maintained, which means taking it out of the XML Schema it is currently in and turning it into a vocabulary standard similar to Darwin Core and Audubon Core. While the Task Group is doing its work, the Interest Group has suspended most other activities. Therefore, while at last year's Interest Group meeting we had more general discussions about what we are looking for in a standard for dealing with taxon information, in this meeting we will do a deep dive into TCS, discussing where we have gotten to so far and which issues need further discussion. As always, we very much like input from people outside the Interest Group, partly because knowing how the wider community feels about things might help resolve differences of opinion within the Interest Group and partly because it is better for issues we have not thought of to come up now than during review. All information can be found in the TCS 2 Task Group's GitHub repository [https://github.com/tdwg/tcs2/](https://github.com/tdwg/tcs2/). 

**Repeated Session (ITG02-R):** November 18, 9:00 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ITG02-R%3A+Taxon+Names+and+Concepts+Interest+Group+%28TNC%29&iso=20211118T09))

## ITG14: Humboldt Extension to Darwin Core Task Group
**Date/Time:** November 17, 13:00 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ITG14%3A+Humboldt+Extension+to+Darwin+Core+Task+Group&iso=20211117T13))

**Session Type:** Interest/Task Group meeting

**Organizers:** [Yanina Sica](mailto:yanina.sica@yale.edu), Yale University, Hamden, CT, USA | Paula Zermoglio , VertNet, Bariloche, Argentina

**Description:** In 2021 the TDWG Humboldt Core Task Group was established to review how to best integrate the terms proposed in the Humboldt Core original publication (Guralnick et al. 2018) with existing standards and implementation schemas. Since the different types of inventories can be thought of as Events with different nesting levels (events within events, e.g., plots within sites), and after an initial mapping to existing Darwin Core terms, it was deemed appropriate to start from a Darwin Core Event Core and build an extension to include Humboldt Core terms. The task group members currently meet every other Wednesday to revise all original Humboldt Core terms, reformulating definitions, comments, and examples, and discarding or adding new terms where needed. We are also gathering real datasets to test the use of the extension once an initial list of revised terms is ready, before undergoing a public review period as established by the TDWG process. At this session we will explain the process we followed, present the preliminary  list of terms that would compose the extension, and invite all of you to join in an open discussion.


## ITG15: Biodiversity Services & Clients IG meeting
**Date/Time:** November 11, 17:30 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ITG15%3A+Biodiversity+Services+%26+Clients+IG+meeting&iso=20211111T1730))
