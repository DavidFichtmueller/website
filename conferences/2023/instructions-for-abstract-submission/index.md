## Getting started

### Introduction

Abstracts are required for all scheduled oral presentations (includes lightning talks) and posters. Abstracts will be published in TDWG's journal, [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)](https://biss.pensoft.net/). **Because abstract publication fees are included in conference registration, all presenters must be fully registered to participate in the conference before their abstract can be published.**

All conference participants are invited to submit abstracts representing their work, however the Program Committee reserves the right to schedule accepted abstracts to fit space and time constraints, as well as the right to limit the number of oral presentations by any single presenting author. The deadline for submission of abstracts is 1 July.

Abstracts should be written in English for a general audience, providing context for your presentation and avoiding unexplained jargon. Abstract submissions are limited to no more than 6,000 characters (including spaces), and may include references, figures, tables, even supplemental material. See [abstracts from past conferences](https://biss.pensoft.net/collections) for examples.

### Process overview

You will be writing your abstract in Pensoft's online publishing platform, ARPHA writing tool. ARPHA allows you and your co-authors to collaborate (although only one person at a time) through the creation and revision process of your draft. Outside contributors (not listed as authors), such as linguistic editors, may be given access to your abstract (see "need help" [below](#abstract)).

After submitting your abstract for review, it will be assessed for suitability for the conference. You will be notified by email of this provisional acceptance **by 15 July** so that you may take advantage of the early registration deadline. Your abstract will be subsequently edited and peer reviewed by session organizers and volunteers from the Program Committee. The review process is designed to not only enhance the accessibility of your content by the general reader, but also to help improve your presentation. 

Abstracts will be published with digital object identifiers (DOIs) upon acceptance and after any registration fees have been paid. 

### Email communications

Email communications within ARPHA are limited. Only the submitting author will receive notifications from the editors. Messages sent within ARPHA to editors go through Pensoft first.

Email interactions (especially in July and August) of the abstract submitter with editors may be necessary before abstracts are accepted for publication. _Be sure to train your email system to recognize and permit emails from pensoft.net._

Communicate with the journal's help desk (in ARPHA) to resolve technical issues or with <editor@tdwg.org> or <conf-organizers@tdwg.org> for content/meeting-related questions.

## To start a NEW abstract 

### Begin on the BISS Homepage

As the person submitting the abstract, you should register or log in to <https://biss.pensoft.net/>. You will need to acknowledge [Terms of Use](https://biss.pensoft.net/about#TermsofUse) if you are new to the system.

### Click button for NEW abstract

After logging in, the button `Start TDWG 2023 Conference Abstract` should be visible on the [BISS homepage](https://biss.pensoft.net). Clicking this button takes you to the ARPHA writing tool and creates a _new_ Untitled abstract with some of the author metadata you used to create your account. _This is the easiest way to start a NEW abstract._ 

While you can now leave your abstract draft here (it will have been assigned an ARPHA identifier, with you as submitter), you are encouraged to start filling out its [required fields](#required-fields). Later, when you return to work on your abstract, follow access instructions [here](#to-return-to-an-existing-abstract). 

Look for an email verification of the creation of your draft abstract in ARPHA (from awt[at]pensoft[dot]net).

**Do not create more than one draft for an abstract that you intend to submit.** To make it easier to see your drafts, Pensoft has added a `My drafts` button (only appears if you _have existing drafts_) on your BISS dashboard, next to `My tasks` and `Submit manuscript` buttons when you sign in through [BISS](https://biss.pensoft.net).

## To return to an EXISTING abstract

Log in to ARPHA directly from <https://arpha.pensoft.net>. Choose title from `My recent manuscripts` OR choose `View dashboard` button to see all manuscripts on which you are listed as an author, their status, and revision history. 

### Required fields

Fields with required data include _Title, Author, Abstract, Keywords, Presenting Author, Presented At, and Collection._

Access all but Collection from the list at the left by hovering over a category, and then clicking on the pencil icon and filling in requested information.

## Collection (Session)

Each Collection (in ARPHA) represents an [organized session](/conferences/2023/session-list/) accepted for TDWG 2023, including posters and contributed oral presentations. Many session organizers have agreed to consider unsolicited contributions, so if you think your presentation would fit an existing topic and organizers have indicated they will consider it, choose that collection, otherwise select Contributed Oral Presentation or Virtual Poster.

**Click `Collections` on the top navigation bar of your manuscript** (top right of figure below) for a drop-down list of sessions. Choose the most appropriate collection for your abstract. Designating a Collection is critical, as your abstract cannot be directed to the proper editors without this assignment. Note that both authors and editors have the ability to [designate a collection](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Add-to-Article-Collections).

![Collections Banner Icon](https://static.tdwg.org/conferences/2020/instructions/2_CollectionsBannerIcon.png "Collections Banner Icon")

## Title

All major words should begin with a capital letter (Title Case), with only the first word capitalized after a colon, unless it is a proper noun. Use italics for scientific names.

Correct: This is the Title of my Awesome Talk: Presented live in Hobart, Tasmania<br>
Incorrect: This is the title of my awesome talk: presented live in Hobart, Tasmania<br>
Incorrect: THIS IS THE TITLE OF MY AWESOME TALK: PRESENTED LIVE IN HOBART TASMANIA<br>
Incorrect: This is the _Title of my Awesome Talk:_ Presented live in Hobart, Tasmania

## Authors

### Submitting author

The **submitting author** is the person who will ultimately be responsible _and available_ to submit your abstract for review to the journal and who will finalize the abstract once approved for publication. ARPHA automatically assumes this to be the person first logging in and starting the abstract and that person's name is assumed to be first author. This can be [changed](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Edit-author-order-details). 

Automated notifications from ARPHA or BISS about abstracts are sent _only_ to submitting authors, although co-authors will see and be able to make changes to abstracts when they appear in _Draft_ status in their [ARPHA dashboard](https://arpha.pensoft.net/dashboard). Only the submitting author will see a button to submit a revised version of the abstract back to ARPHA.
 
### Co-authors

To **[add co-authors](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Add-authors)** hover over Authors in the left-side navigation panel and use the pencil icon to edit these fields. Be sure to add affiliations for all authors. 

When adding co-authors, please specify what rights each will have to comment only or to edit and comment. Note that it is the _submitting_ author's responsibility to notify all authors of this submission and their rights with regard to commenting or editing.

### Corresponding author

Designate one author as the **corresponding author** (the person to whom correspondence should be addressed _after_ publication). May be any author.

### Presenting author

The **presenting author** (added outside of the Authors metadata panel, after Keywords) is the person who will be delivering the presentation at the conference. Type in the name of the presenter in the same way as it is listed as an author. Do not add affiliations. If there are multiple presenters, separate the names with a comma.

_The presenting author will be responsible for a live, recorded, or poster presentation and must be fully registered for the conference by the time the abstract is approved for publication._

## Presented at

Make sure this is filled in with `TDWG 2023` (no more, no less)

## Abstract

**Please write your abstract for a general audience**, providing context for your presentation and avoid unexplained jargon. _Note that this is not a venue for reporting the results of research in your discipline._

**Abstracts should be written in English**, and be appropriate to the conference theme, _Stronger Together: Standards for linking biodiversity data_.

**Be sure to provide references for TDWG or other [standards](/standards/)** used in your work (e.g., [Darwin Core Standard](http://www.tdwg.org/standards/450))

**Character limit.** Abstract submissions are limited to 6,000 characters (including spaces, title, authors and affiliations, keywords, references, etc. but _not_ Supplementary Materials). The `Validate` button will let you know this number. 

**Acronyms and abbreviations.** The first mention of acronyms or abbreviations (including institutional/organizational acronyms and country abbreviations) in the abstract or figure/table legends must be spelled out (exceptions: 3D, API, DNA, RNA, GIS, HTML, WWW, URL, URI, XML, RDF, JPG, TIF, TIFF, PDF).

**Hyperlinks.** Consider [embedding hyperlinks](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Insert-Hyperlinks) or [adding endnotes](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Endnotes) to give recognition to institutions and clarify concepts that will help readers to appreciate more fully the topic you are presenting. This can be especially helpful for jargon. Be mindful of persistence (not having future users find broken links) and irrelevant advertising if you choose to do this.

**Need help** with linguistics or other opinions about your abstract by non-authors? You may [invite contributors](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Invite-contributors) to _Edit & comment_ or _Comment only_ within the manuscript. You may also email <editor@tdwg.org> for help.

## Keywords

List words that readers might use in a search to find your content, but do not add words already found in the title of your abstract.

Separate each keyword with a comma (not a semicolon) and space.

Only capitalize proper nouns; do not capitalize the first keyword unnecessarily.

## References, figures, supplementary materials

You may add [references](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/References), [figures](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Figures), [tables](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Tables) and upload [supplementary materials](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Supplementary-files) associated with the abstract. None of these are required. Create these resources first from the end of the left menu, [before linking them to the appropriate text](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Cite-references) in your abstract.

Any figures, images, or media used in abstracts or presentations must be [credited with their copyright status](/about/terms-of-use/copyright-infringement/#a-general-recommendation-to-presenters), _even if they are your own_. See TDWG's [Terms of Use](/about/terms-of-use/).

## Submit for technical review

Please **proofread** your submission carefully: 

- Double check spelling
- Make sure that all acronyms and abbreviations have been expanded at first use
- References to published work are properly [added](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/References) and [cited](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Cite-references)
- Credit all images with licensing information (see [Terms of Use](/about/terms-of-use/))
- [Keywords](#keywords) not appearing in the title are listed
- The presenter's name appears the same as a listed author
- The `Presented at` field is filled in with `TDWG 2023`
- Verify that all authors agree with content provided. 

Click the `Validate` button to check that you have no outstanding omissions (ensures that mandatory fields are filled in, you have not exceeded the character limit, and the abstract is assigned to a collection) or errors flagged by the system (unresolved track changes or comments).

The submitting author should see the `Submit for Technical Review` button (below the `Validate` button). Clicking this button sends your abstract to the editors for consideration as part of TDWG 2023. **This step must be completed by the deadline of 1 July.**

You should receive an auto-generated confirmation email (be sure to find this in your email). 

On your ARPHA dashboard, the status of the manuscript will change to **in pre-submission review** and will be in read-only mode for authors.

While your abstract is in pre-submission review, you may see the work of various technical editors suggesting changes to be made, or making comments on your abstract but you will only be able to _view, not edit_ your submission yet. Wait until you receive official notice that feedback has been requested—do not ask technical editors to make changes.

## Feedback and revisions

The organizers (technical editors) may accept or reject your submission, or may send feedback requesting (more) changes, and/or indicate that your abstract is being moved to a different collection or format (e.g., oral to poster) for programming reasons.
 
**Draft** (again): if a submission is returned to you for changes, its status will return to _Draft_. Only you and other authors with editing or commenting privileges will have access to the abstract until you make or respond to changes requested and send it back for technical review. 

Editors may have used **[track changes](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Track-Changes)** and/or written comments that need to be addressed. Accept or reject suggestions and use comments as necessary to further communicate your actions. If you have immediate editorial questions, please email <editor@tdwg.org> and reference the ARPHA ID of your abstract in the subject line.

Once you have addressed (i.e., accepted or rejected) any Track Changes (the next / previous buttons will disappear) and resolved the comments, please press the `Validate` button to make sure that all issues have been cleared up. If your manuscript does not validate (i.e., there is more than the number of characters listed), please try to resolve outstanding issues. Sometimes these issues are linked to the source for correcting them; sometimes not. If you are stumped, first try closing the abstract window and going back in; if you still can't find the issue, contact the journal help desk (using feedback icon in top banner) or email <editor@tdwg.org> with the ARPHA# and screen capture or description of your issue.

Your manuscript may require more than one cycle of revision so please address communications promptly. 

## Finalize and submit to journal

Once the submitting author receives notification that their abstract has been approved, they must now go through the process to finalize and submit the abstract to the journal for publication. 

### Steps

1. **Double check the name of the presenting author** (should only be the name as listed as an author) and do a final proofing of your abstract.
2. **Validate.** Next, click the `Validate` button first to make sure there are no lingering issues. See [https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Finalise-a-Manuscript](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Finalise-a-Manuscript). Click on the blue text for each issue to resolve it. A successful validation will only show the number of characters in your abstract.
3. Once approved, the `Submit to the journal` button should become visible (if you do not see this button, you may not be listed as the submitting author (see [Authors](#authors)) in the ARPHA Writing Tool. When you are ready to submit your abstract for publication, click the `Submit to the journal` button and then go through the (long) checklist of submission steps.
4. The first step in the checklist regards the **license and copyright** of your abstract. The default is [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) with copyright attributed to the authors. However, if _any_ author is a U.S. or Canadian government employee, you must specify [CC-0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). Any other issues should be referred to the journal’s help desk.
5. Step 2 requires that you mark the box indicating "I am aware that my abstract will be published only after registering and payment of any fees for the TDWG 2023 conference".
6. The final step asks you to **assign categories** (taxon, geographic area, scientific subject, geological era) to your submission; complete this step if it is applicable, but _be sure to click through to the end of the submission process_.
7. When the submission process is finalised, you should receive an email confirming the successful submission and the abstract goes directly to production for publication, a DOI (digital object identifier) is assigned, and the abstract cannot be revised further (without difficulty).
8. At publication, you should receive a confirmation email from the journal.

### Incomplete submission

If, after your manuscript has been approved, you fail to complete all of the steps in the previous section, you may see it tagged as _Incomplete Submission_ in your ARPHA dashboard, even though a BISS ID has been assigned to it. Because this now has a BISS identifier, you must access actions to complete the submission (or delete it) via the [BISS dashboard](https://biss.pensoft.net/dashboard?view_mode=1&journal_id=63) not ARPHA’s.

![Incomplete Submission](https://static.tdwg.org/conferences/2020/instructions/3_IncompleteSubmission.png "Incomplete Submission") 

_The deadline for finalizing your abstract for publication in the journal will be announced in July, to enable us to prepare the program._

## Seeking help

If, at any time, you need further technical assistance, check the [Tips and tricks](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/) link or if you fail to find an answer to your question, click `Feedback` icon (on the top navigation bar to open a new window with an email form for you to fill in to the journal's technical staff) OR for content/editorial questions, send an email to TDWG Editors <editor@tdwg.org> including the ARPHA ID of your abstract in the subject line. Note that icons now use tooltips (mouse over) and do not otherwise include text explanations. For program questions, please email <conf-organizers@tdwg.org>. 

## ARPHA-related FAQs

### How does the editing process work?

Your abstract will be edited and reviewed for content and suitability as well as style and language by conference and session organizers and other volunteers. Once authors submit an abstract, the collection editors are notified about it, and they gain access to it. Once they evaluate it, and leave notes for its improvement (if any), they send feedback to the authors. At that point you—as the Submitting author—receive an automated notification from awt@pensoft.net, with access in editing mode to the abstract. After you coordinate the modifications with your co-authors, you can resubmit. This cycle can be reiterated as many times as needed, until the abstract is accepted, and ready to be submitted to the journal (to be published as is). Please wait for the system notification.
If, for some reason, your abstract is not accepted by the conference organizers under the collection (e.g., symposium) to which you submitted it, they will notify <editor@tdwg.org> for help in moving it elsewhere, if possible.

### What are the benefits of submitting a published abstract?

See the 2021 Pensoft blog post, [_Not Your Typical Conference Abstract #TDWG2021_](https://blog.pensoft.net/2021/07/13/not-your-typical-conference-abstract-tdwg2021/) (note that links refer to the 2021 conference, not the current one)

### I see feedback and corrections to make in my abstract, but I don't have access. Did I do something wrong?

Don't worry--you did nothing wrong. Your abstract is still undergoing review (status should be in pre-submission review; see below to "How do I know the status of my abstract") and should be sent back to you soon. If you have further questions or issues (e.g., you're going to be out of touch soon for a period of time), email the [organizers of your session](/conferences/2023/session-list/) so they can prioritize providing you feedback, or email <editor@tdwg.org>.

### Where do I enter the state or province under address as an author?

ARPHA does not currently track that information. If you feel it is necessary, add an [ISO 3166-2 code](http://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/subdivisions.html) for your country's subdivision, separating it from the city name with a comma and space.

### My abstract has been approved and it validates but why don’t I see a `submit to journal` button?

You may not be the person who originally submitted the abstract. To check this, open the Authors metadata (top left choice) to Manage Authors and make sure that despite the fact that you may be "Corresponding Author" that `Make submitting author` is not an option to be chosen next to your name _(note that currently this is not working; efforts are being made to restore this function)_. If it is (and one of your co-authors does not have this), click on the button to make you the submitting author, save the changes, and see if you now can submit the abstract to the journal. You may need to log out of ARPHA and/or your browser to have changes made reflect properly when you log back in. Still have issues? Please contact the help desk.

### I use more than one email for my work. How do I choose one?

In the ARPHA editorial platform, you should use only one email account that you check regularly, will have persistence, and that you do not mind being public (the system displays it publicly to other users and in published papers). This way all tasks appointed to the user will be accumulated under a single account and you will not have to log in and out and access several dashboards for a single journal. The editorial platform allows users to have different roles within the same journal and also in other journals hosted by Pensoft. The system does not allow adding more than one email per account and is not set to enable sending a copy of the same notification to an alternative email of the same user. If you have been asked to merge two or more accounts into a single one, Pensoft will need to choose one of the emails as primary. This is also used to send alerts and newsletters of Pensoft journal content to which you may subscribe.

Regardless of email, if you are an author and need to credit a particular institution for the work you are presenting, modify your affiliation in the author metadata for each abstract or manuscript submitted.

### How do I know the status of my abstract?

Sign into [ARPHA](https://arpha.pensoft.net/). Your abstract(s) should be listed under the My Manuscripts tab (text will be gray) on your dashboard. On the right of each manuscript, you can see the status. Note that only one person can work on an abstract at a time (either as authors or editors). If you are not actively working on a manuscript, please close the window to give others a chance to contribute. _Note:_ the dashboard may give misleading indications that someone is editing the manuscript. You can verify if this is true by clicking on the manuscript title.

- **Draft** = authors have editing rights; editors see as read-only; authors must submit the abstract for review for the abstract to be released for editorial assessment.
- **In pre-submission review** = authors see as read-only; technical editors are able to make changes to the abstract and add comments. Authors may see these updates but will not be able to make changes until editors release the abstract back to the authors using the `Send Feedback` button. Pressing the `Send Feedback` button returns the abstract to Draft mode so that authors may respond.
- Once your abstract has been **Approved**, the submitting author will need to **Submit to journal** and complete the final publication checklist (this consists of multiple screens; please be sure to follow it to the end). It then proceeds to **Layout** and is in a queue to be **Published**. **The final deadline for submission to the journal will be determined.** Make sure that the submitting author will be available until the process is complete.
- If you fail to complete the final publication checklist, your abstract may be marked as **Incomplete submission**. You will get three automated warnings to remedy this before the system automatically buries/removes your submission from the publication queue.
- Both authors and technical editors can send email (see icon near the top of the page) to co-authors and/or editors at any time during the pre-approval process, **this does not change the status of the manuscript.** _If you use this step, please fully reference your manuscript ID, the issue(s) and the person(s) you think should be responding to the email. The system sends individual emails out so no one receiving them knows who else is being asked to address your question. If in doubt, email <editor@tdwg.org> outside of the system instead.
- For an abstract associated with TDWG 2023 to be published, the presenter must be fully registered (i.e., any assessed fee paid) for the conference.
- Approved abstracts will be published once the placement of their presentation in the program is confirmed. Authors should receive notification of successful submission to the journal, pending publication. 

### What if I don’t see my abstract anywhere?

It is possible that you have more than one ARPHA account under different emails. Please consolidate them if this is the case.

Another possibility is that the ARPHA platform has automatically archived your abstract due to prolonged inactivity (does so after three ignored email warnings). You will need to notify Pensoft to retrieve such an abstract from this fate. Please make sure all communications include an article identifier (ID#) in the subject line. When it is returned, it will be in Draft mode and you will need to need to [submit for technical review](#submit-for-technical-review). Editors are not able to work on or accept a manuscript in Draft status.

Otherwise, communicate with the help desk (use the feedback icon located in the top banner of your abstract) to try to resolve technical issues or with <editor@tdwg.org> or <conf-organizers@tdwg.org> for content/meeting-related questions.

### Where will I find published abstracts?

See [published abstract collections](https://biss.pensoft.net/collections) and select current year's volume. Sign up for [email notifications](https://pensoft.net/profile/alerts/edit) of newly published content from Biodiversity Information Science and Standards after signing in.
