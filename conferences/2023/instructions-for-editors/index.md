## Role of editors

Thank you for volunteering to review and/or edit abstracts submitted to your session. Your review will be conducted in the [ARPHA](https://arpha.pensoft.net/) writing platform and will consist of a mark-up of the abstract using Track Changes (to correct spelling, grammar, and style) and Comments to ask questions and make suggestions about content. There is no separate narrative review. A single person will be identified within each group to serve as the Session Coordinator to organize the review process and communicate with authors during the review.

It is your responsibility as editors (a.k.a. technical editors) to ensure the acceptance of only high quality, well-written abstracts that will enhance the reputation of our organization, the conference, and this journal.

All presentations (oral and posters) listed in the conference program are to be published before the conference in TDWG’s open access journal, Biodiversity Information Science and Standards ([BISS](https://biss.pensoft.net/)). Your efforts will be credited as an editor of any collection on which you work (see [TDWG Proceedings 2023](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/408/)). 

If you feel unable to do this task, would like additional guidance, or help, please contact <editor@tdwg.org>. We plan to conduct online training sessions in June for those needing a refresher or are new to the ARPHA platform.


## What authors see

Please review [TDWG 2023 instructions for abstract submission](#instructions-for-abstract-submission). This will help you understand the ARPHA workflow from the author’s point of view and what is expected of you. You will be notified of newly submitted abstracts via email from pensoft.net. Be sure to whitelist this sender in your email client.

## Organize your team

- Assess the strengths of each member of your team (i.e., among the organizers listed for your session)
  - Who has used ARPHA before as an author and/or editor?
  - Who may need a refresher or extra training?
  - Who can review for content and suitability for your session?
  - Who can edit for language?
  - Who is available in July, particularly 1–15 July for preliminary assessment?
  - Who is diplomatic and comfortable communicating with authors and confident in setting and following up on deadlines for responses updating drafts?
- Based on the results above, choose one person who will be responsible for coordinating the editorial process for your session and available throughout the month of July (or until all abstracts have been approved for publication). Send the name of that person to <editor@tdwg.org> by 1 June 2023 

## Understanding flags

ARPHA provides flags to editors to track the progress of an abstract during the review process. Editors have access to setting flags only when they have control over the abstract in the “in pre-submission review” stage. Note that authors cannot see these flags.

### Flags used during preliminary assessment

- **Accept with revisions** - an assessment of whether an abstract will ultimately be accepted for presentation at the conference. It does not imply placement of where it was submitted only that it will have a place in the program.
- **Move** - indication that the (sub)collection ([session](/session-list)) should be changed but that the abstract should still be accepted for the conference. Please also, contact <editor@tdwg.org>.
- **Reject** - reserved for those abstracts deemed out of scope or otherwise unsuitable for submission to the conference. 
- **Remove** - reserved for abstracts that are duplicate or withdrawn for whatever reason

### Flags used during editorial review process

- **Language reviewed** - Abstracts are written in English, but what flavor? British or American or Canadian or ? Whatever the flavor, the style and spelling should be consistent (e.g., organisation OR organization NOT both) and above all, be comprehensible (no unexplained slang, unexpanded acronyms, or jargon) by readers. If in doubt, ask for a second opinion at <editor@tdwg.org>.<br>
   If sufficient changes/clarifications are identified during this review that might impede a proper content review, notify the Session Coordinator to send feedback to authors early, before excess time is spent on content.
- **Content reviewed** - Authors should provide needed context and a coherent flow of information in their abstract. Please help authors focus their ideas where necessary to fit the work of TDWG, the session to which it is submitted, and the conference and make abstracts approachable by a general (non-specialized) audience. <br>
   Should be reviewed by at least one if not two additional editor/reviewers (abstracts are rarely sent out for external review, but if you have a question about content, contact <editor@tdwg.org>).
- **Revise** - recommendation made generally once both review types are completed (exception is if language review is extensive and required to complete content review). This flag signals that the Session Coordinator can now `Send feedback` to authors; may be an iterative process. 
- **Move** - If the abstract is not a good fit for your collection (session), but you think it might be appropriate for a different collection ([session](/session-list)) or as a poster presentation, please contact the <editor@tdwg.org> with your suggestion and we will work to get it reassigned.
- **Remove** - reserved for abstracts that are duplicate or withdrawn for whatever reason.
- **Approve** - when the last of the Track Changes and Comments are sorted and the Validation only shows the number of characters, the Session Coordinator should mark the flag for approval and record it in the abstract tracking spreadsheet. This will signal to the volume editors that the abstract is ready to be finalized for publication.


## Workflow

### Preliminary assessment

All session editors will receive an email announcing the submission of an abstract to their session (=collection in ARPHA). The session coordinator (see above) will make sure that all abstracts undergo preliminary assessment for the suitability of the abstract for publication and presentation at the conference and once a consensus is reached, will flag it accordingly in ARPHA and record the flag in the abstract tracking spreadsheet by 15 July 2023 deadline*.

_**The preliminary assessment is not a review**, and there is no required feedback to be submitted to the author yet and the abstract and no one should use the Send Feedback button._

### Editorial review process

The diagram below splits the editorial process into two parts but both the Review for Language and the Review for Content need to be assessed before the Session Coordinator uses the Send Feedback button to communicate with the author about revisions and clarifications needed/requested by the reviewers. An exception may be made if the language review is extensive and is a barrier to assessing content.

![ARPHA Review Process](https://static.tdwg.org/images/journal/arpha-review-flowchart.png "ARPHA Review Process Flowchart")

## Reviewer roles

### Session reviewers

- Suggest changes to wording using ARPHA’s [Track Changes](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Track-Changes) or [Comment](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Comments) features 
- Use [flags](#understanding-flags) in ARPHA to mark editing progress
- Address editing tasks promptly to enable maximum time and flexibility for dealing with authors
- At least two people should review each abstract, addressing both language and content reviews.

### Session coordinator

- Communicate a strategy and timeline to your team for achieving editorial progress and goals
- `Validate` the abstract to see that character limit is not exceeded
- `Send feedback` to authors based on session reviewers comments
- Provide a deadline for dealing with revisions (no more than 1 week)
- Follow up with authors that appear not to have seen the notification that revisions are required (do this outside of ARPHA, using a personal email that references the ARPHA ID of the abstract)
- Work with authors, reviewers, and editors (<editor@tdwg.org>) to reach the target to flag to approve the abstract (editors will make the final approval for publication).

## The review

### What to watch for

The most frequent non-compliance with the journal’s standards, which need to be corrected are:

- Missing authors’ affiliations,
- Non-active or missing links (URLs),
- Missing references to concepts or existing standards (e.g., TDWG standards)
- Incorrect citing of the references (reference cited in text does not match reference from list),
- Non-expansion of acronyms at first use,
- Typos and wording issues, particularly, but not exclusively from authors for whom English is not primary,
- Titles should be in title case (e.g., Title of Awesome Talk: Why are we here?),
- Missing Keywords and Presented at metadata (latter should be filled in with “TDWG 2023” and only that),
- Keywords not separated by commas and capitalization of non-proper nouns,
- Presenter name(s) should match the format of author (no title or other affiliation information, just the name).

### Revision history

Confused about who has reviewed or touched an abstract? Access the Revision history from your [dashboard](https://arpha.pensoft.net/dashboard?showall=1&state_type=23) for the abstract or use the counterclockwise icon in the top ribbon of the ARPHA writing tool.

### Validation and flag for approval

When the last of the Track Changes and Comments are sorted and the Validation only shows the number of characters, mark the flag for approval.

Only volume editors of the Proceedings will send out approval notices that ask authors to finalize a checklist that will put the abstract in Pensoft’s publication workflow.

## Communication with authors

The Session Coordinator should be the primary contact with authors. Communications should be constructive and civil. 

### Steps to sending feedback

Clicking the `Send Feedback` button brings up a questionnaire with default answers in the affirmative to which you may make changes (recommend ignoring this form as it can cause confusion with authors later). Click “Save and Proceed” to bring up an email to the submitting author that you can customize.

As authors are often unfamiliar with how the editing process works, create a template you can grab and customize as desired.  It may include the following:
- Typically this should encourage authors to accept changes they agree with, but keep track changes on if they continue to add/change content so that you can easily see other changes they may make to the document.
- Add a deadline for responding (e.g., no more than 1 week).
- Note, you will not receive a copy of this email.
- If the deadline passes without anyone appearing to work on the draft, follow up with a personal email outside of ARPHA (they may not have seen the notification)
- The ARPHA platform may send out automatic reminders to authors in the case of prolonged inactivity at critical stages and after three ignored notifications will automatically archive (remove the abstract from view) such manuscripts. Either you or the author will need to notify Pensoft to retrieve such an abstract from this fate.

This process (submission -> send feedback) can be repeated for as long as necessary, but keep in mind the 1 August deadline by which we hope all authors will know whether their abstract has been/will be approved for publication and all presenters fully registered for the conference.

## Abstract status

You should be able to see all abstracts that have been submitted to your collection in [ARPHA’s Collection editor](https://arpha.pensoft.net/dashboard.php?&showall=1&state_type=23) view (you will need to be logged in). On the right hand side in the dashboard you can see the status of the abstract and the subcollection (i.e. “Part of” collection) to which it was submitted. Some of you may be technical editors of more than one collection. Here is a short explanation of the document statuses:

### Draft

The abstract has not yet been submitted by the authors OR it has been returned to the authors for revision (via “Send Feedback”). Editors will have read-only access at this time.

### In pre-submission review

It is now the responsibility of you and your team to review the abstract, and mark its progress through flags (see figures [1](#preliminary-assessment) and [2](#editorial-review-process) above). While an abstract is in pre-submission review, authors may see your comments, but they will not have access to the manuscript until it is returned to them in the Send Feedback step.

### Rejected

Only submissions that are not relevant to the conference goals or collections will be rejected. If the abstract is not appropriate or does not fit in your collection, flag it and notify <editor@tdwg.org> of your opinion.

### Approved for submission

Only designated editors at editor@tdwg.org will have access to the `Approve` button (this is not the flag). Once the button is pushed, it will be up to authors to finalize the [abstract submission process]. See the [instructions for abstract submission](/2023/instructions-for-abstract-submission/) for a description and various places where authors may run into trouble (including Validation unsuccessful and Incomplete submission).

### Incomplete submission

This is abstract purgatory. The abstract was approved for submission and the author began to finalize it but did not finish. See [instructions to authors](2023/instructions-for-abstract-submission/#incomplete-submission).

### In layout

Author has completed the final submission process, a BISS# has been assigned, and the abstract is awaiting publication.

### Published

A DOI has been implemented and the abstract is [available to the world](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/408). Abstracts cannot be withdrawn at this point. Any changes to presenter or placement are non-trivial.

## Additional Information

### Communicating with authors

The Session Coordinator should be the primary contact with authors and the editors (editor@tdwg.org). Session Editors should work with their Session Coordinator to convey additional observations or questions about a review that may not appear in the comments in ARPHA. Please be constructive and civil in all communications (comments and emails) with authors and remember TDWG's [Code of Conduct](/about/code-of-conduct). Email authors through

- Send Feedback button - changes status of abstract to return control to authors
- Email Co-authors button - does not change status; editors retain control
- Your institutional email (please cc <editor@tdwg.org>) - always reference the AWT# (ARPHA Writing Tool ID#) in the subject line (found in URL of abstracts, communications from Pensoft, and in the list of abstracts under collection editor on your [ARPHA dashboard](https://arpha.pensoft.net/dashboard)); use as follow-up to ARPHA notifications.

### Communications from Pensoft

Emails originating from “pensoft.net” are often interpreted by overzealous email systems as potential spam. Please whitelist or otherwise train your email system to recognize these vital communications. You will receive notifications (from awt@pensoft.net) for each abstract in ARPHA for which you are a technical editor. If you share the email, please remove links first. You will not be able to tell who else may have received the same notification in auto-generated emails. Emails will reference the collection to which the abstract was submitted in both the subject line and in the body of the email, as well as the journal name (body only).

### Update your profile

Please [create or update your profile](https://pensoft.net/profile) in Pensoft. Make sure that you have only one email address registered.

### For additional help

Email <editor@tdwg.org>) with issues about content and procedure. Check [online help](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Edit-sections) (marked as Tips in ARPHA). Contact Pensoft’s technical staff by clicking “Helpdesk” on the top navigation bar if you need additional technical assistance. If you have suggestions for how the workflow can be improved, please send them to <editor@tdwg.org>. Remember to ALWAYS include an ARPHA# or BISS# in the subject line of all communications.
