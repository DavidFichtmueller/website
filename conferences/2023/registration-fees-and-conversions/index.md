# Registration

A link to the online registration site will posted here as soon as the site goes live.  (Expected the first week of July.)

## In-person and virtual participation

TDWG 2023 will be a hybrid conference with in-person and virtual participants.  All participants, including presenters, must register.  

**In-person** registration includes:  the welcome reception, coffee/tea breaks, lunch on session days, and the conference dinner.  Excursions on Wednesday may entail an additional charge. 

Both in-person and **virtual participants** will receive a login to the conference platform and will have access to live streamed presentations as well as session recordings within 24 hours. (All sessions will be recorded.)  Virtual participants will be able to present any accepted contribution live, but scheduling will necessarily be a compromise between the presenter's time-zone and session subject matter. Virtual presenters will be required to submit a pre-recorded video to serve as backup should a network problem arise.  

Chat and message functions will support interaction among all participants.   

## Categories

- **TDWG members** receive a discount on their registration fees approximately equivalent to membership dues.  Institutional members may take the discount on up to five (5) participants. Discount codes have already been mailed to individual and institutions who have paid dues in 2023.
- **Non-members** pay the full registration fee, but may opt-in to become a TDWG member for 2023.  (See [benefits of TDWG membership](https://www.tdwg.org/about/membership/#benefits-of-membership).)
- An **early-bird discount** is available until 18 August.

The following categories of participants receive even larger discounts on registration fees.

- **Post-docs** and **retired professionals**
- **Students,** both undergraduate and post graduates
- Participants from **lower-middle and low-income economies** ([See list](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups).)

(The early-bird discount is not available to the more heavily discounted categories.)
