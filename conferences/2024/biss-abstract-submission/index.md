## Getting started

### Register for SPNHC-TDWG 2024

Registration is now open for the conference [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/registration/](/conferences/2024/registration/) and all presenters must be registered before their abstract will be published. Early bird rates for in-person attendance expire 8 July 2024.

### Introduction

Extended abstracts may be submitted for any accepted oral presentation (including lightning talk) or poster—they are encouraged but not a requirement for presentation. Abstracts will be published in TDWG’s journal, _Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)_ ([see more](/conferences/2024/why-extended-abstract/). Abstract publication is a benefit of your conference registration. Acceptance of an abstract in the Oxford Abstracts (OA) conference platform does not guarantee acceptance of publication of an extended abstract.

**The deadline for submission of extended abstracts is 15 July.**

Abstracts should be written in English for a general audience, providing context for your presentation and avoiding unexplained jargon. Your abstract may include references, figures, tables, even supplemental material. See [abstracts from past conferences](https://biss.pensoft.net/collections) for examples. Abstract submissions are limited to no more than 6,000 characters (including spaces of all document content; only supplemental materials are excluded from this count).

### Process overview

You will be writing your abstract in Pensoft’s online publishing platform, ARPHA writing tool. ARPHA allows you and your co-authors to collaborate through the creation and revision process of your draft. Outside contributors (not listed as authors), such as linguistic editors, may be given access to your abstract (see “need help” below).

After submitting your abstract for review, your abstract will be subsequently edited and peer reviewed by [session organizers](/conferences/2024/sessions/) and volunteers from the [Program Committee](/conferences/2024/program-committee). The review process is designed to not only enhance the accessibility of your content by the general reader, but also to help improve your presentation.

Abstracts will be published with Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) after necessary registration fees have been paid and the abstract has been finalized and submitted to the journal by the submitting author. _The submitting author does not have to be the same person who submitted program abstracts in Oxford Abstracts, but should be an author who is available to respond to reviews and implement changes required for publication._

### Communications

Email communications within ARPHA are limited. Only the submitting author will receive notifications from the editors. Messages sent within ARPHA to editors go through Pensoft first.

Email interactions (especially in July and August) of the abstract submitter with editors may be necessary before abstracts are accepted for publication. Be sure to train your email system to recognize and permit emails from pensoft.net.

Communicate with the journal’s help desk (in ARPHA) to resolve technical issues or with [editor@tdwg.org](mailto:editor@tdwg.org) or [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org) for content/meeting-related questions.

## To start a NEW abstract

### Begin on the BISS homepage

As the person submitting the abstract, you should register or log in to [https://biss.pensoft.net/](https://biss.pensoft.net/). You will need to acknowledge [Terms of Use](https://biss.pensoft.net/about#TermsofUse) if you are new to the system. If you do not receive the system notification containing your account confirmation link, please contact Pensoft’s team at [journals@pensoft.net](mailto:journals@pensoft.net) for assistance.

### Click button for NEW abstract

After logging in, the button `Start SPNHC-TDWG 2024 Conference Abstract` should be visible on the [BISS homepage](https://biss.pensoft.net/). Clicking this button takes you to the ARPHA writing tool and creates a new Untitled abstract with some of the author metadata you used to create your account. _This is the easiest way to start a NEW abstract._

While you can now leave your abstract draft here (it will have been assigned an ARPHA identifier, with you as submitter), you are encouraged to start filling out its required fields. Later, when you return to work on your abstract, follow access instructions here.

Look for an email verification of the creation of your draft abstract in ARPHA (from awt[at]pensoft[dot]net).

Do not create more than one draft for an abstract that you intend to submit. To make it easier to see your drafts, Pensoft has added a `My drafts` button (only appears _if you have existing drafts_) on your BISS dashboard, next to `My tasks` and `Submit manuscript` buttons when you sign in through [BISS](https://biss.pensoft.net/).

## To return to an EXISTING abstract

Log in to ARPHA directly from [https://arpha.pensoft.net](https://arpha.pensoft.net). Choose title from `My recent manuscripts` OR choose `View dashboard` button to see all manuscripts on which you are listed as an author, their status, and revision history.

### Required fields

Fields with required data include _Title, Author, Abstract, Keywords, Presenting Author, Presented At, Conflicts of interest, and Collection._

Access all but Collection from the list at the left by hovering over a category, and then clicking on the pencil icon and filling in requested information.

Regarding the `Conflicts of interest`, you will be asked to specify if your abstract is (co-)authored by an editor in BISS. Select No unless Gail Kampmeier or Elycia Wallis are co-authors on your abstract.

## Collection (Session)

Each `Collection` (in ARPHA) represents an [organized session](/conferences/2024/sessions/) accepted for SPNHC-TDWG 2024, including posters, lightning talks, and contributed oral presentations. Verify your session here. 

Click `Collections` on the top navigation bar of your manuscript (top right of figure below) for a drop-down list of sessions. Choose the appropriate collection for your abstract. Designating a Collection is critical, as your abstract cannot be directed to the proper editors without this assignment. Note that both authors and editors have the ability to [designate a collection](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Add-to-Article-Collections).

![Collections Banner Icon](https://static.tdwg.org/conferences/2020/instructions/2_CollectionsBannerIcon.png "Collections Banner Icon")

## Title

Use title case. Verify with [Title Case Converter](https://titlecaseconverter.com/) (select [MLA](https://titlecaseconverter.com/rules/#MLA) for title style).  Italicize scientific names.

## Authors

### Submitting author

The submitting author is the person who will ultimately be responsible and available to submit your abstract for review to the journal and who will finalize the abstract once approved for publication. ARPHA automatically assumes this to be the person first logging in and starting the abstract and that person’s name is assumed to be first author. The author order can be [changed](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Edit-author-order-details), and the initial submitting author may be able to grant this role to another co-author. For help in changing the submitting author, please email [journals@pensoft.net](mailto:journals@pensoft.net) and reference the ARPHA number in your email.

Automated notifications from ARPHA or BISS about abstracts are sent only to submitting authors, although co-authors will see and be able to make changes to abstracts when they appear in Draft status in their [ARPHA dashboard](https://arpha.pensoft.net/dashboard). Only the submitting author will see a button to submit a revised version of the abstract back to ARPHA.

_It is the responsibility of the submitting author to make sure that all co-authors are aware of and agree with the information presented, that their contact information is correct, consistent (i.e., all authors from the same institution appear under the same superscript) and in the proper order in the chain of co-authors._

### Co-authors

To add [co-authors](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Add-authors) hover over Authors in the left-side navigation panel and use the pencil icon to edit these fields. Be sure to add affiliations for all authors.

When adding co-authors, please specify what rights each will have to comment only or to edit and comment. Note that it is the _submitting_ author’s responsibility to notify all authors of this submission and their rights with regard to commenting or editing.

### Corresponding author

Designate one author as the corresponding author (the person to whom correspondence should be addressed _after_ publication). May be any author or more than one author.

### Presenting author

The presenting author (added outside of the Authors metadata panel, after Keywords) is the person who will be delivering the presentation at the conference (this should be consistent with the person listed as presenter on the conference platform). Type in the name of the presenter in the same way they are listed as an author. Do not add affiliations or honorifics. If there are multiple presenters, separate the names with a comma.

_The presenting author will be responsible for a live, recorded, or poster presentation and must be fully registered for the conference by the time the abstract is approved for publication._

## Presented at

Make sure this is filled in with `SPNHC-TDWG 2024` (no more, no less).

## Abstract

### Requirements

Please write your abstract in English for a general audience, providing context for your presentation and avoiding unexplained jargon. _This abstract is an expanded version of what has been submitted and accepted for presentation at SPNHC-TDWG 2024._

Be sure to provide references for TDWG or other [standards](/standards/) used in your work (e.g., [Darwin Core Standard](/standards/450)).

### Character limit

Abstract submissions are limited to 6,000 characters (including spaces, title, authors and affiliations, keywords, references, etc. but _not_ Supplementary Materials). The `Validate` button will let you know this number.

### Acronyms and abbreviations

The first mention of acronyms or abbreviations (including institutional/organizational acronyms and country abbreviations) in the abstract or figure/table legends must be spelled out (exceptions: 3D, AI, API, DNA, RNA, GIS, HTML, WWW, URL, URI, XML, RDF, JPG, TIF, TIFF, PDF).

### Hyperlinks and endnotes

Do not show URLs as part of the abstract text (e.g., in parentheses). 

Use [embedded hyperlinks](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Insert-Hyperlinks) in text to supply helpful (e.g., links to institutional webpages, jargon or expanded acronyms), but not critical or unique to understanding your abstract. These links will not appear in the printed version of your abstract, so use of them can be considered value-added for those with an electronic version. 

However, when it is essential to the appreciation of your content (e.g., resources specific to your work) that links are visible in any format, [add](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Endnotes) and [cite endnotes](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Cite-Endnotes). These may appear as references to URLs that are spelled out at the end of the document.

Be mindful of persistence (not having future users find broken links) and irrelevant advertising if referencing commercial sites.

### Editorial help

If you have used AI to compose your abstract or translation tools to make automatic translations, please seek confirmation from an independent source—before submitting the abstract for review—that the abstract truly reflects your work. 

Need help with linguistics or other opinions about your abstract by non-authors? You may [invite contributors](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Invite-contributors) to _Edit & comment_ or _Comment only_ within the manuscript. You may also email [editor@tdwg.org](mailto:editor@tdwg.org) for help.

## Keywords

List words that readers might use in a search to find your content, but do not add words already found in the title of your abstract.

Separate each keyword with a comma (not a semicolon) and space.

Only capitalize proper nouns; do not capitalize the first keyword unnecessarily.

## References, figures, supplementary materials

You may add [references](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/References), [figures](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Figures), [tables](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Tables) and upload [supplementary materials](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Supplementary-files) associated with the abstract. None of these are required. Create these resources first from the end of the left menu, [before linking them to the appropriate text](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Cite-references) in your abstract.

Any figures, images, or media used in abstracts or presentations must be [credited with their copyright status](/about/terms-of-use/copyright-infringement/#a-general-recommendation-to-presenters), _even if they are your own_. See TDWG’s [Terms of Use](/about/terms-of-use/).

## Acknowledgements

Use the optional fields `Funder`, `Funding program`, `Grant title`, `Hosting institution` to acknowledge supporters or institutions that you wish to thank or acknowledge for their contribution to the underlying research or support of your abstract. Be sure to solicit any additional acknowledgements from your co-authors. Keep in mind that the version you submit to the journal will be published as is and the workflow does NOT include an exchange of proofs with those acknowledged.

Aside from the specific fields above for acknowledging supporters, institutions, or grants, there is a general `Acknowledgements` field for recognizing the use of AI generative tools or translation software in the creation of the abstract and to show appreciation for the help of people who were not co-authors.

## Submit for technical review

Please proofread your submission carefully:

- Double check spelling
- Make sure that all acronyms and abbreviations have been expanded at first use
- References to published work are properly [added](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/References) and [cited](https://arpha.pensoft.net/tips/Cite-references)
- Credit all images with licensing information (see [Terms of Use](/about/terms-of-use/))
- [Keywords](/conferences/2024/biss-abstract-submission/#keywords) not appearing in the title are listed
- The presenter’s name appears the same as a listed author and in the conference platform
- The `Presented at` field is filled in with `SPNHC-TDWG 2024`
- Verify that all authors agree with content provided.

Click the `Validate` button to check that you have no outstanding omissions (ensures that mandatory fields are filled in, you have not exceeded the character limit, and the abstract is assigned to a collection) or errors flagged by the system (unresolved track changes or comments).

The submitting author should see the `Submit for Technical Review` button (below the `Validate` button). Clicking this button sends your abstract to the editors for consideration as part of SPNHC-TDWG 2024. This step must be completed by the **deadline of 15 July**.

You should receive an auto-generated confirmation email (be sure to find this in your mailbox).

On your ARPHA dashboard, the status of the manuscript will change to in pre-submission review and will be in read-only mode for authors.

While your abstract is in pre-submission review, you may see the work of various technical editors suggesting changes to be made, or making comments on your abstract but you will only be able to view, not edit your submission yet. Wait until you receive official notice that feedback has been requested—do not ask technical editors to make changes.
