## Breaking News!

Have you given up on a BISS abstract because you can’t make the July 15th deadline?

**_Don’t worry, We have a solution for you!_**

Do you believe that you won’t have everything you need to complete your submission by the deadline?

**_We’ve got you covered! You can still make it work!!_**

We have **extended the deadline to July 24th** for you to start your abstract. Now you have two options.

### Option 1

If you’ve got everything you need, except a few extra hours, your wish has come true. You now have an extra 9 days to complete and submit your abstract for review. Our kudos to you.

### Option 2

If you don’t have everything you want to include yet, Surprise!! All you need to get started is the abstract you submitted to Oxford Abstracts a couple of months ago. That’s all you need to start the process now – you can finish later and you have all of the details you want to include in your abstract. Just get it started and BISS will keep your place until you're done.

#### Here is what you need to do before July 24th

1. Complete steps 1–4 under [Getting started](/conferences/2024/biss-abstracts-tldr/#getting-started) - this is the basic stuff, registering and starting your abstract.
2. Complete steps 1–4 under [Abstract requirements](/conferences/2024/biss-abstracts-tldr/#abstract-required-fields) - just a few easy steps using the information you already submitted to Oxford Abstracts (in some cases, you don’t even need that much).
   1. For the abstract, copy and paste your OA abstract as a placeholder (so you know what will need to be expanded)
   2. If you do not have a copy of your OA abstract, leave it blank or [find it here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SXIfwKg6TYs5dWZrsKO5NgASWSW3KUaP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112437040868151967020&rtpof=true&sd=true)
   3. If you are missing other information, i.e., authors, fill them in later

That’s it! Done! You’ve created a draft of your abstract. Now you can return to it later when you are ready to complete the process.

**IMPORTANT!!  DO NOT SUBMIT** the abstract for review if you choose Option 2. When you complete the steps detailed above, your abstract should remain as a [draft](/conferences/2024/biss-abstract-submission/#abstract-status) that you can return to in ARPHA to complete at a later time (see #5 under [Getting Started](/conferences/2024/biss-abstracts-tldr/#getting-started)). Submitting your abstract for review prematurely will cause you to be unable to update and complete your abstract. Plus, our reviewers will be grateful to avoid having to edit your abstract twice.

Be sure to pay attention to any emails received from Pensoft reminding you about the status of your abstract. When you are ready, [complete all of the other steps](/conferences/2024/biss-abstracts-tldr/) (or see [more detailed instructions](/conferences/2024/biss-abstract-submission/)) and [submit your abstract for review](/conferences/2024/biss-abstract-submission/#submit-for-technical-review). 

Please consider taking a few minutes to complete these easy steps and generate a draft of your abstract. We’ve even given you extra time to do so. Please take advantage of this opportunity to realize [all of the benefits to submitting to BISS](/conferences/2024/why-extended-abstract/).

Oh, and, lest you become lazy or forgetful, we’ll remind you to get that abstract done in a timely manner. You will need to finish the job sooner than later so we can publish the collection when the meeting has concluded.

See the original call, including eligibility, full instructions and more information below.


## Original call

We are pleased to announce the call for extended abstracts (mini-papers) for the joint hybrid conference of SPNHC-TDWG 2024 to be published in [_Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)_](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/438/). 

**The deadline for extended abstract submission is ~~15 July 2024~~ NOW 24 July 2024.**

Wondering why you might want to submit an extended abstract when your presentation has already been accepted on the Oxford Abstracts (OA) conference platform?  See all the reasons why here: [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/why-extended-abstract/](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/why-extended-abstract/) 

**Eligibility.** Only authors with abstracts [approved for presentation](/conferences/2024/#abstracts-submitted-to-oxford-abstracts)) at the conference are eligible to submit an extended abstract as a benefit of their registration for the conference. _The person submitting the extended abstract to BISS can be a different co-author from the one who submitted the original abstract to the conference program._ It is important that this submitting author be available to handle reviews in a timely manner.

**Full instructions** for extended abstract submission may be found at [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/biss-abstract-submission/](/conferences/2024/biss-abstract-submission/) but if you are already familiar with abstract submission to _BISS_, you may elect to use the shorter summarized version, [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/biss-abstracts-tldr/](/conferences/2024/biss-abstracts-tldr/) 

**Please direct any questions** about extended abstracts to [editor@tdwg.org](mailto:editor@tdwg.org); questions about the conference should be directed to [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org).

We look forward to receiving your extended abstract submissions by ~~15 July 2024~~ **NOW 24 July 2024**!
