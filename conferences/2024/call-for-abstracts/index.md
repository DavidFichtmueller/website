# Call for Abstracts - Deadline 19 April 2024

_Last updated 4 March 2024_

## About the Conference

We are pleased to announce the call for abstract submissions to SPNHC-TDWG 2024, a hybrid conference hosted jointly by the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections ([SPNHC](https://spnhc.org/)) and Biodiversity Information Standards ([TDWG](https://tdwg.org/)). The conference will be held 2–6 September 2024 in Okinawa, Japan. In addition to opening and closing plenaries, the conference will feature symposia, workshops, lightning talks and panel discussions as well as contributed oral presentations and virtual posters (see [Sessions list](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/sessions/)).

### Invitation to submit abstract

At this time, we invite you to submit abstracts for 15-minute oral presentations, poster presentations, and lightning talks. Content may be presented in-person or pre-recorded. We are working on providing the technology to support remote participation for presenters. Accepted abstracts will be published via [Oxford Abstracts](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/6771/homepage) (OA). Final approval for publication requires payment of any conference registration fees by the presenter. Authors additionally will have the option to publish an extended version of their abstract in _Biodiversity Information Science and Standards ([BISS](https://biss.pensoft.net/collections/))_, where slides and video recordings can be associated (details to be announced in May). Please visit the [conference website](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/) for more information and to see details in the [Submission Guidelines for Abstracts](https://tdwg.org/conferences/2024/oa-abstract-submission-guidelines).

## What you need to know

- See the [Submission Guidelines for OA Abstracts](https://tdwg.org/conferences/2024/oa-abstract-submission-guidelines)
  - Examine the [list of sessions](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/sessions/) to see which are open to outside abstract submissions and may fit your topic. 
  - You will be asked to choose a session _after_ you submit your form.
  - To submit to a CLOSED session, you must have prior consent of the session's organizers.
  - If none of the sessions seem to fit your topic, submit it in a contributed session or as a (virtual) poster.
- Not all submissions for oral presentations may be granted due to scheduling difficulties. In such cases, presenters will be asked to present a virtual poster (with a short pre-recorded video).
- When you are ready to start your abstract, follow the [Submission Guidelines for OA Abstracts](https://tdwg.org/conferences/2024/oa-abstract-submission-guidelines) - **deadline 19 April 2024**
