While the [Code of Conduct](/conferences/2024/code-of-conduct/) sets out the expectations for behavior and comportment at the conference as well as Okinawan cultural considerations, this document collects and answers questions not necessarily treated in the Code. 

**For questions about the Code of Conduct** or additions to this document, please contact [ccc@tdwg.org](mailto:ccc@tdwg.org)</br>

{:id="collecting-specimens"}
## Q. Can I collect specimens while I'm in Okinawa?

All collection activity requires permitting, export/import documents and could involve international treaties and protocols. Even wildlife products (such as sea shells) purchased as souvenirs may require documentation and export/import declaration and could be CITES regulated. We ask that participants in the conference abide by the concept of “Take only pictures and memories. Leave only footprints.”

{:id="emergency-services"}
## Q. What are numbers to call for emergency services in Japan?

Call **110** to reach local police if you encounter a traffic accident or criminal incident while you are in Japan, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For medical (ambulance) or fire emergency, call **119**. Ask for an operator who speaks English. You will need to have your phone enabled to contact these local emergency services by either activating a Japan-specific SIM, a global SIM, or an international roaming service through your mobile network provider. If you don’t have access to any of these services, use a hotel room phone or ask for help from anyone near you.
