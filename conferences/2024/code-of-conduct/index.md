## SPNHC ‚Äì TDWG 2024 Code of Conduct

**Purpose:** The Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC), and Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG), are dedicated to providing a safe, productive, welcoming, and enjoyable environment for all involved regardless of ethnicity, religion, national origin, professional status, physical appearance, physical ability, neurodivergence, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Attendees are expected to abide by the Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility guidelines of [SPNHC Inclusion Statement](https://spnhc.org/spnhc-inclusion-statement/) and [TDWG Diversity and Inclusion Statement](https://www.tdwg.org/about/diversity-inclusion/). **By registering for and/or participating in conference sessions, workshops, panels, field trips, social events, or any other activity related to the SPNHC ‚Äì TDWG 2024 Conference, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. This includes activities within the local community. As a participant in the conference, you represent our organizations and the shared values of our chosen professions.**

SPNHC and TDWG prohibit all forms of verbal, physical, or written harassment, intimidation, hazing, threats, discrimination, abuse, and/or coercion for any reason. At the discretion of the Conference Organizing Committee in liaison with representatives from SPNHC and TDWG, attendees and/or participants engaging in any of the prohibited offenses listed may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference and/or future SPNHC or TDWG events without warning or refund, reported to the appropriate authorities, and/or subject to other actions necessary to retain the safety and integrity of the conference.

**Expectations:** All participants and attendees are to maintain constructive and civil discourse at all times, with respect given to differences in backgrounds and ideologies. Constructive and civil discourse includes but is not limited to, speakers honoring designated time limits, attendees being aware of balancing speaking and listening time, and welcoming attendees new to our community or early in their careers. They should be mindful of and respect cultural norms, including, but not limited to, appropriate attire, language, and customs. If a participant or attendee has a question about these expectations, send an email inquiry to [ccc@tdwg.org](mailto:ccc@tdwg.org). 

Authors and presenters must abide by the highest scientific attribution and citation standards. The use of translation software or AI text generation should be explicitly indicated with its usage (e.g. proof editing, text written from scratch, text enhancement, etc.). The use of AI image generation should be clearly cited. Authors and presenters are solely responsible for using original images/graphics they own or otherwise have explicit permission to use. Any license granting use (e.g., from Creative Commons) must be prominently displayed. These meetings will be recorded and shared at a later date on a public video platform to enhance the reach of the mission of both Societies. Conference attendees may not share links to streaming or on-demand conference sessions with non-registrants of the conference (e.g., to social media).

**Okinawan Cultural Considerations:** Okinawa, being a part of Japan, boasts a distinctly unique history, culture, and natural environment, having nurtured exchanges and blending of all people across boundaries and inherited the spirit of _Bankoku Shinry≈ç_ (a bridge across the great many nations) that has supported Okinawa‚Äôs prosperity over generations from the era of the Ryukyu kingdom until today.

Bear in mind the Okinawan spirit that is reflected in two Uchinanchu words that have been passed down from ancient times, ‚Äú_Chimugukuru_‚Äù (sincerity, compassion) and ‚Äú_Yuimaaru_‚Äù (mutual assistance), and please behave with appreciation and care for its unique history, culture, and nature. Please also treasure all existing limited resources in Okinawa, including water and energy.
