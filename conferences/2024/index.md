## SPNHC-TDWG joint conference

  - The Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections ([SPNHC](https://www.spnhc.org)) is an international organization devoted to the preservation, conservation and management of natural history collections.
  - Biodiversity Information Standards ([TDWG](/)) develops and maintains data standards that support the integration of primary biodiversity information across disciplines, organizations, and nations. Its annual conference has become a preeminent forum for advancing biodiversity informatics.

SPNHC and TDWG first met jointly in 2018 (Dunedin, New Zealand).  The joint conference was widely viewed as beneficial to both organizations and something we should do periodically. TDWG last met in Asia in 2012 (Beijing), and SPNHC has never met in Asia.  By holding our second joint meeting in Okinawa, Japan, our organizations welcome new participants from across Asia.  Please join us and meet your colleagues from around the world!

## Organized Sessions

A general call for proposals of sessions (e.g., symposia, panels, workshops) was distributed in January 2024 (deadline 16 February). The proposed sessions were categorized and reviewed by the Program Committee and [posted on the conference website](/conferences/2024/sessions/) in advance of the call for abstracts. 

## Call for abstracts

The [call for abstracts](/conferences/2024/call-for-abstracts/) for individual oral or poster presentations in Oxford Abstracts is now open. Please see the [Submission Guidelines for OA Abstracts](/conferences/2024/oa-abstract-submission-guidelines/). **DEADLINE: 19 April 2024**

## Visa requirements

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan is the recommended site [https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) for information about visas for traveling to Japan.

## Accommodations

The conference will be held at the Okinawa Convention Center (OCC), not a hotel, so we have not arranged for room-blocks to be held at one or more local hotels.  We recommend looking at the hotels listed under [Neighborhood Accommodations](https://www.oki-conven.jp/en/neighborhoodaccommodations/) on the OCC website, or simply searching for nearby hotels on your favorite travel or mapping site.
