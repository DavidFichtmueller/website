## SPNHC-TDWG joint conference

  - The Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections ([SPNHC](https://www.spnhc.org)) is an international organization devoted to the preservation, conservation and management of natural history collections.
  - Biodiversity Information Standards ([TDWG](/)) develops and maintains data standards that support the integration of primary biodiversity information across disciplines, organizations, and nations. Its annual conference has become a preeminent forum for advancing biodiversity informatics.

SPNHC and TDWG first met jointly in 2018 (Dunedin, New Zealand).  The joint conference was widely viewed as beneficial to both organizations and something we should do periodically. TDWG last met in Asia in 2012 (Beijing), and SPNHC has never met in Asia.  By holding our second joint meeting in Okinawa, Japan, our organizations welcome new participants from across Asia.  Please join us and meet your colleagues from around the world!

## Organized Sessions

The call for session proposals (e.g., symposia, panels, workshops) was distributed in early January 2024 and closed 16 February. Proposals for sessions were reviewed by the Program Committee and more than 35 sessions (mostly symoposia) were provisionally accepted. See the session descriptions on our [Sessions page](/conferences/2024/sessions/). 

## Call for abstracts

The [call for abstracts](/conferences/2024/call-for-abstracts/) for individual oral or poster presentations in Oxford Abstracts (OA) has now closed. Abstracts will undergo review and authors will be notified by 15 May about their status.

An opportunity will open to submit _extended_ abstracts (based on successful abstracts submitted to OA) to _Biodiversity Information Science and Standards ([BISS](https://biss.pensoft.net/collections))_. Details to be announced later in May.

## Daily schedule

The conferece days will be Monday - Friday (2-6 September), but note that Monday is a half-day beginning with the Welcome remarks and plenary presentations.  Specially arranged excursions will be offered on the preceding Sunday (1 September) and the following Saturday (7 September).

## Visa requirements

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan is the recommended site [https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) for information about visas for traveling to Japan.

## Accommodations

The conference will be held at the Okinawa Convention Center (OCC), not a hotel, so we have not arranged for room-blocks to be held at one or more local hotels.  We recommend looking at the hotels listed under [Neighborhood Accommodations](https://www.oki-conven.jp/en/neighborhoodaccommodations/) on the OCC website, or simply searching for nearby hotels on your favorite travel or mapping site.
