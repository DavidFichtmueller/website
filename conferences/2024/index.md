## Conference program

SPNHC TDWG 2024 will include symposia, panel discussion, workshop, lightning talks, demonstrations, general contributed papers, and plenary presentations. See the session descriptions on our [Sessions page](/conferences/2024/sessions/).  

## Abstracts

### Call to submit extended abstracts to _BISS_

The [call for extended abstracts](/conferences/2024/biss-extended-abstract-call/) in [_Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)_](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/438/) is now open. See [why you should submit an extended abstract](/conferences/2024/why-extended-abtract/) when you have already had your abstract accepted in Oxford Abstracts. **Deadline for submission of extended abstracts is 15 July 2024.**

### Abstracts submitted to Oxford Abstracts

More than 390 abstracts for oral presentations and posters were reviewed by session organizers and members of the Program Committee between 22 April–12 May.

**Notifications of acceptance** for presentation at the conference were emailed to abstract _submitters_ (not to all authors) on 15 May through the Oxford Abstracts conference platform. These notifications included an invitation to submitters to respond to reviewer comments/corrections by editing their abstracts (deadline now passed: 29 May). Presenters were reminded to [register for the conference](/conferences/2024/registration/) to secure their place in the program. Presentations are now being organized into the final schedule. Please address questions to [editor@tdwg.org](mailto:editor@tdwg.org).

**Did you miss the email** notifying you of the acceptance of your abstract submission? Sign into your account on Oxford Abstracts and if your abstract appears, it was accepted (contact the person who submitted the abstract if this was not you). We are still finalizing the placement of abstracts in sessions, so your session may change.

If your country of citizenship requires that you obtain a visa for entry into Japan, you will most likely also need a Letter of Invitation for your visa application.  To request the Letter of Invitation, please send the following information to [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org), who will confirm your registration and forward your request to our local hosts.

## Accommodations

The conference will be held at the Okinawa Convention Center (OCC), not a hotel, so we have not arranged for room-blocks to be held at one or more local hotels.  We recommend looking at the hotels listed under [Neighborhood Accommodations](https://www.oki-conven.jp/en/neighborhoodaccommodations/) on the OCC website, or simply searching for nearby hotels on your favorite travel or mapping site.

## About the SPNHC-TDWG joint conference

  - The Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections ([SPNHC](https://www.spnhc.org)) is an international organization devoted to the preservation, conservation and management of natural history collections.
  - Biodiversity Information Standards ([TDWG](/)) develops and maintains data standards that support the integration of primary biodiversity information across disciplines, organizations, and nations. Its annual conference has become a preeminent forum for advancing biodiversity informatics.

SPNHC and TDWG first met jointly in 2018 (Dunedin, New Zealand).  The joint conference was widely viewed as beneficial to both organizations and something we should do periodically. TDWG last met in Asia in 2012 (Beijing), and SPNHC has never met in Asia.  By holding our second joint meeting in Okinawa, Japan, our organizations welcome new participants from across Asia.  Please join us and meet your colleagues from around the world!
