### Online Submission Portal

We welcome your submissions for abstracts via the SPNHC-TDWG 2024 conference platform on Oxford Abstracts.

**Sign in or create an account** with Oxford Abstracts [https://auth.oxfordabstracts.com/?redirect=virtual/event/6771/homepage](https://auth.oxfordabstracts.com/?redirect=virtual/event/6771/homepage) before accessing the submission portal. Note that event organizers will use this email to communicate with you about the conference and your abstract submission.

**Access the submission form** [https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/8623/submitter](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/8623/submitter) after signing in.
As the submitter, you will be asked to fill out the following form fields. Responses to nearly all questions are required (*), although some fields within those questions may be optional. Where there are word limits, you are responsible for remaining within the guidelines. 

- __Title*__ 
  - Enter the FULL TITLE of your submission. 
  - There is a 20-word limit. 
  - Please italicize taxonomic names as appropriate. 
  - Do not use all upper case or use terminal punctuation. 
  - This will be used for printing in the final program.
- __Presentation type*__ 
  - Choose either Oral or Poster. 
  - Oral presentations include submissions to symposia, general, contributed, lightning talk, and keynote sessions. 
  - Abstracts are not required for workshops, panel discussions, or demo camp.
- __Authors and affiliations*__ 
  - Enter the names of all authors in the order in which they should appear in the program. 
  - Do not use all uppercase lettering on names. 
  - The system only allows one author to be designated as the presenter. 
  - Optional fields within this category include ORCID ID, Institution, City, and State. 
  - You may include multiple affiliations for any author. Please make sure that affiliations from the same institution for multiple authors are entered in an identical manner.
  - Affirmation that the presenter will register for the conference
- __Abstract*__
  - There is a 300-word limit on abstracts. 
  - Please italicize taxonomic names as appropriate.
- __Use of Generative AI__
  - This field may be left blank if no generative AI technologies were used to create this abstract.
  - Examples of such technologies include ChatGPT and Google Translate.
  - There are no penalties for such assists but they should be acknowledged.
  - The use of corrective technologies such as Grammarly or a spelling checker do not have to be listed (and are in fact, appreciated by the reviewers)
- __Funding program__
  - This field is not required
  - If applicable, a short statement (30 word limit), may be entered about how your project was funded. 
  - This will appear in the abstract book
- __All author approval*__
  - This required affirmation confirms that the submitting author has provided the contents of the submission to all listed authors and that they approve of its submission for presentation at SPNHC-TDWG 2024.
- __Permission to publish*__
  - This required affirmation gives permission to the organizers of SPNHC-TDWG 2024 to publish this abstract on electronic media and in hardcopy (i.e., in the abstract book, program, and poster gallery) if it is accepted for presentation.
 

**Hit SUBMIT**  You may pause in the completion of this form at any time but MUST hit the submit button to save and be able to return to it before the deadline. Hitting submit will do two things:

- Generate an email about the status of your abstract submission, including a link to access it for revisions.
- Provide a list of sessions (see [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/sessions/](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/sessions/)) for you to ATTACH your presentation. 
  - Although the system allows you to submit your abstract without choosing to amend your abstract by attaching your presentation to a session, this is in fact a choice that we require that you make. 
  - Submission confirmation emails from the system about your abstract not only do not flag that this choice has not been made, but they will tell you your submission is complete. 
  - Please confirm that you have chosen to amend your abstract by attaching it to a session.

**Modification of submission**. You will be able to modify your abstract after submission up until the deadline of 19 April 2024 11:59 HST.

**Multiple submissions**. If you wish to submit more than one abstract, please complete a separate form for each. Presenters may be limited in the number of oral presentations that may be accommodated due to scheduling. 

**Submission withdrawal**. If you wish to withdraw your abstract, please contact editor@tdwg.org. 

## Review Process and Notification

Each submission will be reviewed by a panel selected by the Program Committee, including at least one organizer from the session to which you attached your submission. Reviews will take place between 22 April and 10 May 2024. Reviewers are not editors, but may elect to make minor changes to abstracts as required. The submitter will be notified by email regarding the outcome of their submission by **Wednesday 15 May 2024**. 

If your abstract is accepted, the presenter will need to register for the conference (deadline to be announced). Instructions for presentation and uploading of slides, posters, and pre-recorded videos will be announced before the deadline for submission of abstracts.

**Publishing in BISS**. Authors of OA abstracts accepted for presentation at the conference will have the additional opportunity to publish an extended abstract in TDWG's Pensoft publication, _Biodiversity Information Science and Standards [(BISS)](https://biss.pensoft.net)_. Details of this opportunity will be provided in May. Meanwhile, past proceedings may be viewed [https://biss.pensoft.net/collections](https://biss.pensoft.net/collections), along with links to slides and videos under the media tab of individual abstracts.
