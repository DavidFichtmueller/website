## Presentation preparation:

### About presentations

- **Time:** Oral Presentation slots are designed for **10 minute presentations**, +3 minutes of questions, and +2 min of transition to the next speaker (total 15 min). Please respect the fact that moderators will be tasked to keep their sessions on time so your presentation should not exceed 10 minutes in length. 
- **Lightning talks** ([LTNG02](/conferences/2024/sessions/#ltng02) and [LTNG05](/conferences/2024/sessions/#ltng05) are scheduled for **5 minutes (total)**, to include questions and transition to the next speaker. Slide numbers are limited (see linked descriptions)  
- **Remote presenters** must upload a pre-recorded file to the relevant folder for their session by **19 August**. Links will be emailed to presenters via Oxford Abstracts (and MailChimp as a backup).
- **Language:** while the language of the conference is English, we are experimenting again this year with allowing speakers to present in a language other than English IF the presentation is pre-recorded and includes English subtitles and slide content. Please email okinawa2024@spnhc.org if you would like to try this.
- **Poster presenters**, please see separate instructions.

### Slide format

- All presentations should be saved as PowerPoint (pptx), OpenDocument Presentation (ODP) or PDF files. If you use Google Slides, please download them as one of these formats.
- An optional template, designed for SPNHC-TDWG 2024 by Daphne Hoh, is available for your use. [Download a copy of the file](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zW4feT5K33qymUyU5b37_jRrGykR0UpE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112437040868151967020&rtpof=true&sd=true) to personalize it for your presentation. 
- Please format all slides for 16:9 size. Try to avoid putting critical content in the top right corner of your slides (where the speaker is often displayed in video).
- Do not embed videos, use animations or fancy slide transitions that might slow, bloat the file size or otherwise hinder the presentation on Zoom.
  - If sound or video must be embedded in slides, prior notice must be given [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org)
- For better legibility, use sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) and avoid using font sizes <18 pt. Remember that this will be a hybrid conference, slides will be projected in front of the audience onsite, but they may also be viewed on small screens by the virtual attendees.
- Provide high contrast between text and background.
- Avoid color blindness traps (e.g., requiring viewers to distinguish between reds and greens on your chart) (see [simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)).
- Avoid using all uppercase text (more difficult to read).
- Minimize the amount of text on each slide.
- Minimize the number of slides in your presentation (ca. 10 = about 1/minute).
- Use high quality graphics/images but no larger (file size) than necessary for the screen resolution.
- Present a story for your audience and put your work in context.
- Want more inspiration? See the TDWG Webinar: [Your Slides, Your Story, Your Attitude: Make your Presentations Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi0OkL8y8Ac)
- Use QR codes to share URLs you would like the audience to visit
- [Choose a Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) for your slides (or use license chooser [here](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/)) and explicitly state the license either as part of the slide template (shown on all slides) or at least on your title slide. Your abstract already has either a [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) or [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.
- Do not include material (particularly images) under copyright that is not yours to share. Provide attribution for all images including content belonging to the authors. See TDWG's [Terms of Use](https://www.tdwg.org/about/terms-of-use/) and [cautionary tale of copyright infringement](https://www.tdwg.org/about/terms-of-use/copyright-infringement/).
- Optional: provide contact information e.g., [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/), email, or social media handle.

### Pre-recorded presentations

- Even if you have pre-arranged with the organizers to present remotely online, you will need to provide a pre-recorded version of your talk, not exceeding 10 min in duration as a backup in case of any technical or internet issues. 
- The recommendations under [Slide Format](#slide-format) apply. 
- Pre-recorded presentations should be saved as MP4 formatted files. 
- Please use a headset with a microphone for best quality audio.
- If your recording includes you in the video, please ensure that your camera is at the level of your head. (If you are looking down at your computer and camera, we’re looking up your nose ;-/ ).
- Upload your pre-recorded presentation to the relevant folder for your session by **19 August 2024**. The link to upload your session will be provided by email via MailChimp.

### Uploading your slides & pre-recorded video

- File naming convention: Please title the file to your talk using the following filename convention: **SessionCode_OAidentifier_YourFamilyName** Examples of the SessionCode include SYM01, DEMO01, LTNG05. [Find your OAidentifer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SXIfwKg6TYs5dWZrsKO5NgASWSW3KUaP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112437040868151967020&rtpof=true&sd=true) (Column A). 
- Upload pre-recorded presentations and slides to the relevant session folder (link sent separately). 
- IMPORTANT: To ensure that your file remains in its original format and does not get converted to Google Slides 
  - Go to the link provided and find the folder for your session (open the folder)
  - Click 'New’ then 'File upload.'
  - After uploading, right-click your file in the folder and ensure that ’Open with Google Slides’ is not selected. 
- Upload of the final version of videos and slides to be presented live (in-person or streaming) by 19 August 2024.
- If you are late uploading your slides, please contact your session moderator and [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org) to let them know.

## Presenting your talk

- Practice your presentation and timing so as not to exceed 10 minutes.
- Remember this is a diverse international audience who may not be familiar with customs, acronyms, and jargon used in your speciality. Help everyone appreciate your work by speaking clearly, avoiding slang, and explaining potentially unfamiliar terms. Also avoid very rapid delivery.
- All sessions and talks will be recorded and made available to registrants for subsequent on-demand viewing after the session. 
- If presenting onsite, please be at the conference room where your presentation is scheduled at least 15 min before your session begins.
- The default for virtual presenters is to play their video during their session, unless a compelling reason is made to the session organizers for presenting remotely online (Zoom call and screen sharing). The decision to support live, remote presentations will be determined on a case by case basis. Separate instructions will be provided if this is granted.
- Slides will be started and displayed by the Audio Visual Technical Support team via a computer in the conference room. You will be able to advance your slides from the lectern.

## Additional thoughts

Want to make your talk more interactive? Consider creating a poll in Zoom for your audience. Work with your moderator/[session organizers](/conferences/2024/sessions/) to create polls in advance.
