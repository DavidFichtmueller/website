## Cancellation policy

We hope you will join us at SPNHC-TDWG 2024 in person and online! However we recognize that unexpected changes occur. At any time, we encourage in-person delegates who are unable to travel to switch to be a virtual delegate.

### Cancellations

**Cancellation up to 16 August, 23:59 JST (UTC+9):** cancellations for in-person attendance will receive a full refund, less fees, excursions (which must be booked and cancelled separately), and T-shirts. Fees retained may include transaction and exchange fees, plus printing and food services.  

**Cancellations between 17 August, 00:00 JST and 30 August, 16:59 JST (UTC+9),** will be refunded at the rate of 50%, excluding excursions and tours.

**Cancellations after 30 August, 17:00 JST (UTC+9),** for in person attendance: no refund. In-person delegates who are unable to travel at the last minute will be automatically switched to be a virtual delegate. 

Other fees retained will support the subsidies we have offered to students and our colleagues from low and lower-middle income economies. 

**In-person no-shows with no correspondence** will not be refunded.

For alterations or cancellations to your registration please notify the SPNHC-TDWG Organizing Committee via email, [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org).

### Excursions & Tours

Cancellations, substitutions, and other changes for excursions and tours must be made via the operator of the excursions. SPNHC-TDWG 2024 is not affiliated with the organising or payments associated with these experiences. All requests must be directed to the specific excursion or tour vendors or organisers in accordance with their respective terms and conditions.

### Substitutions

Substitutions of delegates are allowed at any time before 30 August, 2024 17:00 JST (UTC+9). Substitution of a presenting author by an alternative person (usually a co-author) is allowed up to 30 August, 2024 17:00 JST (UTC+9).

For substitution of delegates please notify the SPNHC-TDWG Organizing Committee via email, [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org).
