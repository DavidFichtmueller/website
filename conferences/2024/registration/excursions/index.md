## Booking

### Special rules and instructions - UPDATED!

  * **You may now register for more than excursion.** Register for one tour on Sunday, September 1st and another on Saturday, September 7th. In addition to these tours you may also register for paid excursions to the Kerama Islands and/or Yanbaru as long as there are no scheduling conflicts. We have a limited number of seats available, so we need to give others an opportunity to register, too.
  * If you are traveling with a partner, spouse or family member, you can register them for a tour at the same time, including Kerama and Yanbaru tours.
  * **NEW!!** A short waiting list has been created for up to three people for those excursions that have sold-out. A Google Form is available on the [registration site](https://va.apollon.nta.co.jp/SPNHC-TDWG2024/joho?MODE=top) if you wish to put your name on a waitlist (not including Yanbaru tours). Just remember that no spots are guaranteed for people on the waitlist.
  * **NEW Virtual Tours are now available.** See Japan Toursims Agency Excursions below.
