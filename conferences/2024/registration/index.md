## SPNHC TDWG 2024 registration

We are pleased to announce that registration for the SPNHC-TDWG 2024 Joint Meeting in Okinawa, Japan, is now open.

Before you register, please be aware of the **IMPORTANT** requirements around registration described below.

[Register for SPNHC TDWG 2024!](https://register.oxfordabstracts.com/event/6771?preview=false){:.btn .btn-secondary}{:target="_blank"}

### Special offer

The **first 120 people** to register for in-person attendance by the end of June will be granted two special privileges. These individuals will be:

1. Given exclusive early access to registration for our Okinawan excursions.

2. Entered into a raffle to win one of many prizes. Five individuals will be selected to win one-year memberships to both SPNHC and TDWG. Other individuals will win fun prizes from Okinawa.

So step up and sign up!

### IMPORTANT for registration

- If you are the organizer of a session or the designated presenter of an abstract at this year’s meeting, **you MUST register using the same email address used for your session or on the abstract submission**. This is how your registration will be linked to your abstract. (See [details and remedies below](./#oa-email).)

- With your registration you agree to adhere to the [TDWG 2024 Code of Conduct](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/code-of-conduct/) during your participation in conference sessions, workshops, panels, field trips, social events, or all other activities related to the SPNHC-TDWG 2024 Conference.

- It is your responsibility to obtain a [visa to travel to Japan](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/#visa-requirements) if it is required for entry from your country of citizenship or residence. Before you request supporting documents (e.g., letter of invitation) from SPNHC-TDWG’s local committee you must register and pay in full before we can agree to assist you in support of your visa request. Please visit the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) website for information about visas for traveling to Japan from your country.

### Registration add-ons

Registration for our Bingo Night (this year’s version of the trivia night) and sales of our conference T-shirt are not yet included in registration while we finalize our logistics. As soon as they are ready we will announce that you can reserve a space or buy a shirt.

### Excursion and tour updates

Registration for excursions is separate from meeting registration. When the excursion sign ups are available, we will send a separate announcement.

Most excursions will be scheduled for Sunday (Sept 1) prior to the start of the meeting and Saturday (Sept 7), so please plan accordingly. An additional excursion (yes, it’s a secret for now) will be available on Aug 31/Sept 1 and on Sept 7/8.

Please see the [meeting website](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/) for more information about the meeting, travel and accommodations. If you experience any difficulty with registration, please visit our registration FAQ.

If you have any questions, please email the Planning Committee at [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org).

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

{:id="oa-email"}
### One email to rule your identify in Oxford Abstracts (OA)

- The system matches registration email addresses with presenter email addresses to verify your registration status (and your eligibility to be part of the program for SPNHC-TDWG 2024)
- If you do not already have an OA account, create one that reflects the email used for you as an author/presenter and for when you register for the conference https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/dashboard
- If you already have an account with OA, make sure that the email associated with your account is also the one used on your abstract(s) and when you register. This is critical if you are a presenter.
- DO NOT make a second account to try to fix this
- If you want to use a different email than the one associated currently with your account,
  - please sign in with your existing account information
  - go to your profile and update the email address with the one on your abstract and the one you will use to register for the conference.
- Alternatively, you update your abstract(s) with your current account email - best practice is to check all abstracts where you are a co-author but not the submitter
