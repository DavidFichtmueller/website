## DRAFT schedule of sessions

We are pleased to share with you a more detailed version of our conference schedule, in which sessions have been given explicit dates and times. Please note that all times in this schedule are subject to change, though we do not anticipate any major revisions. 

The order of presentations within sessions is (in part) the responsibility of session organizer(s).  We are doing our best to avoid conflicts, where a presenter or coauthor has two presentations at the same time. 

**TIME SENSITIVE:** We have tried to email all virtual presenters who have not yet registered. If you didn't get the email, we need to know where you will be while particpating virtually. Please **[see here](https://mailchi.mp/tdwg.org/spnhc-tdwg-2024-urgent-tell-us-how-you-will-participate)** and provide your location and time zone as soon as you can (best by 5 July). 

Session Organizers please note, sessions have been expanded or contracted to accommodate the number of submissions received, which might be more or less than the length requested. 

We expect detailed scheduling to be completed by mid July and will notify participants by email and by publishing the program schedule on the conference website and the conference platform (Oxford Abstracts).
