title: Why submit an extended abstract in BISS?
description: I already submitted my abstract to Oxford Abstracts (OA). Why should I expand and publish it as part of the SPNHC-TDWG 2024 conference proceedings in Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)?

Each extended abstract is a peer-reviewed mini-paper designed to provide you with a value-added, easily citable snapshot of your work. It is not a verbatim repetition of your abstract in OA. Using Pensoft’s ARPHA writing tool, you can enhance and lengthen your abstract, so that it includes figures, keywords, references, even supplementary materials. Slides, posters, and a link to the video of your presentation can also be added to the abstract’s media tab after the conference, to build a well-rounded presentation of your work. Each published abstract can link to your ORCID, will have a DOI assigned (see below), and provides metrics about views, downloads, citations, or even online mentions of your work. 

Abstracts you submitted to OA were purposefully kept succinct (≤300 words) to facilitate prompt review  with limited editorial suggestions for the purposes of programming the conference. We also aimed to provide notification to authors in a timely manner for planning their travel. However, TDWG has had a successful partnership since 2017 with Pensoft Publishing (joined by SPNHC in 2018) to publish the Proceedings of its conferences, including those of Biodiversity_Next 2019. This opportunity is being extended to those desiring to take advantage of it for SPNHC-TDWG 2024. This is a benefit of your registration for the conference and acceptance of your presentation. There is no additional cost attached to publishing your extended abstract and there are other benefits to doing the additional work.
Additional benefits of publishing your extended abstract include

- Free and open access to your abstract in perpetuity  via TDWG's open access Pensoft journal, Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS).
- Automatic linking of your abstract to your author record via ORCID and/or Web of Science (Publons) ResearcherID.
- A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) assigned to each abstract. This DOI is a unique, persistent, and citable reference that enables your abstract to be part of your publishing history above and beyond the conference proceedings. 
_Note that during and following the conference, your abstract in Oxford Abstracts will only be visible to conference delegates. The abstract will require a login to OA to see it, and will not be publicly accessible. No DOI will be minted for individual abstracts in OA._
- Distribution of abstracts under the terms of Creative Commons attribution licenses, either CC BY 4.0 (default) or CC0 (by request).
- At least two editors will review and may provide editorial comments for each abstract.
- Post-publication, readers can comment or ask questions within the Comment tab in the publication. Authors may also use the Comment tab for updates or errata.
- To prompt discoverability, all articles, including abstracts, are automatically harvested upon publication by a range of indexers, from AGRICOLA to ZDB.
- Abstracts will be associated with the conference session in which they are presented.
- Easy to promote your presentation by sharing your abstract on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Mendeley, Reddit, or via email with a single click, thanks to share buttons.
