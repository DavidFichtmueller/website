## Public comment opened for subjectPart and subjectOrientation controlled vocabularies.

The Audubon Core Maintenance Group has opened public comment on the proposal to add two vocabularies to the Audubon Core Standard. These vocabularies provide controlled values for the existing terms subjectPart and subjectOrientation to describe what organism part is depicted in an image and how the depicted part is oriented. To view the proposal, read the Implementation Experience Report submitted by the task group, and comment, visit the proposal on the Audubon Core GitHub issues tracker at https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/245. The comment period will last until at least 01 December 2022.  Make comments by adding to any existing open issues in the [Audubon Core repository](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/), or by creating a new issue there.
