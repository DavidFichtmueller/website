Nominations are open for positions on the [Executive Committee](../) of Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) for terms spanning 2023-2024.

This is an opportunity to lead the development of biodiversity informatics and work with an enthusiastic team to improve the quality and interoperability of biodiversity data.

TDWG is an international organization that promotes the digitization, integration, and sharing of information about the world’s biodiversity. TDWG provides a forum where individuals, projects, and institutions who manage biodiversity data can come together to share expertise and promote interoperability by promulgating standards and best practices. TDWG also publishes the Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS) journal where papers on issues related to information technology and biodiversity science can be published. The TDWG Executive Committee oversees the work of TDWG. It coordinates TDWG's Interest and Task Groups, manages the review and ratification of standards, manages the organization’s journal, and organizes the annual meeting. These responsibilities are set forth in the [Constitution](/about/constitution/) and detailed further in a [supplementary document](../responsibilities/).

Positions on the executive are staggered two-year terms, such that no more than half of the Committee will be new each year. Towards the end of every calendar year, TDWG holds elections for terms that are expiring and need to be filled for the coming year. Officers elected this year will serve terms in the caledar years 2022 and 2023. The the schedule and procedures for nominations and the election are detailed below, followed by open positions, their responsibilities, and nominees.

## Nomination procedure

To nominate someone for one of the positions above, first confirm that the nominee is willing to accept the responsibilities of the office.  Then work with the nominee to send a brief statement of the nominee’s background and vision (maximum 400 words) to the TDWG Secretary ([secretary@tdwg.org](mailto:secretary@tdwg.org)).  Self nominations are accepted.  All nominations must be complete and received before **15 November 2021**.

## Election procedure

The TDWG Secretariat will post the names of nominees below and with links to their statements background and vision.  Shortly after nominations are closed, the Secretariat will distribute ballots to all institutional and individual members in good standing.  In the case of institutional members, we will notify the primary and secondary contacts, but only one ballot response will be accepted. If you are uncertain about your membership status, please inquire with the TDWG Treasurer ([treasurer@tdwg.org](mailto:treasurer@tdwg.org)). Institutional ballots will be weighted as five individual ballots.


## General responsibilities

All officers, including subcommittee chairs, have voting rights on the Executive Committee, and are expected to participate in the Committee’s conference calls, which are generally every two weeks. Executive Committee members are expected to find their own support to attend the annual conference.

### Technical Architecture Group, Convener

[Responsibilities](/about/committees/tag/#responsibilities)

**Dr. Steve Baskauf, Vanderbilt University Heard Libraries, Nashville, Tennessee, USA**

I have been an active participant in TDWG since 2009 and have served in a variety of leadership roles since then. They include: review manager of Audubon Core, co-convener of the RDF/OWL Task Group, convener of the Vocabulary Maintenance Task Group, current convener of the Audubon Core Maintenance Group, current convener of the Views Controlled Vocabularies Task Group, and member of the Darwin Core Maintenance Group, the Technical Architecture Group (TAG), and others. I was the lead author of the Standards Documentation Specification (SDS), lead author of the Vocabulary Maintenance Specification, lead author of the Darwin Core RDF Guide, lead author of three controlled vocabularies, and co-author of several other standards documents. I am also a major contributor to the development of the TDWG standards maintenance infrastructure (standards metadata and landing pages) and to bringing existing standards documents into conformance with the SDS.

If elected, my first priority would be to refine the organizational and documentation infrastructure to make the TAG the active group envisioned in its charter. There are currently numerous draft standards that are nearing completion, so this is a critical time for the TAG to exert its oversight role. A longer-term priority is to examine the role that feature and implementation experience reporting play in the overall standards development process, and to bring the TDWG Process into line with our aspirational peer standards organizations in this area. To ensure the success of the group, I would leverage the deep knowledge and technical expertise that already exists within TDWG by recruiting core members from across the community.

**Nominees:**

  - Mareike Petersen -- Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin <br /> &nbsp;
    - **_Background:_**  For the past eight years, I have been involved in various national and international research projects to improve access to and use of natural science collections. I am interested in advancing data linkage mechanisms and optimizing the management of research and collection data and its open access. I am a biologist by training with a scientific background in herpetology (amphibian ecology and taxonomy). At the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (MfN), I am leading the science data and media management team, work on the mobilization of content to subject-specific and cross-domain portals (e.g. GBIF or Europeana), open access to research data, and on the application and further development of data standards (e.g. in the context of TDWG). Recently, I am strongly involved in the multifaceted information management linked to the digitization project of MfNs’ collections and in the development and establishment of the European research infrastructure DiSSCo (e.g. leading Work package and tasks in DiSSCo Prepare, contributing to Synthesys+). In order to open up information from research processes and information about objects in research collections, to enrich it semantically, and to make it accessible for further use, I bridge the gap between the requirements of research, management of research collections, and the technical implementation by developers. Solving these tasks in an interdisciplinary team is often challenging, but at the same time, it enriches my daily work.  <br /> &nbsp;
    - **_Vision:_**  I am enthusiastic about TDWG complexity and member several Interest and Task Groups and in addition since 2020 Chair of the subcommittee ‘Outreach and Communication’. During the last two years, the subcommittee re-worked TDWGs Vision and Mission Statement in an inclusive process and developed a new logo to increase TDWGs memorability. I would like to further work on a better visibility of TDWG, its standards and their application, importantly also beyond the biodiversity informatics and natural science domain through new communication material and channels. TDWGs’ key messages and achievements need to be transported to stakeholders and potential new user groups around the world, even in in current times, where travelling and meetings in person are limited or impossible at all.


### Time and Place, Chair  <!-- to serve 2023-24 -->

[Responsibilities](/about/committees/tardis/#responsibilities)

**Dr. Patricia Mergen, Botanical Garden, Meise; Royal Museum of Central Africa, Tervuren, Belgium**

As a member of the Association of International Associations based in Belgium and many contacts with the "Meet in" or "visit" or "Tourism" (town, country) I am happy to have TDWG continue to benefit from those connections to find support for venues. Additionally the contacts with the local scientific, technical potential hosts is very important within our network.

If elected, I would continue to act as a relay between potential hosts and TDWG Executive. The goal remains to have venues identified on a 3 to 5 years horizon. I would also continue to push regional representatives to play a bigger role in this committee and other TDWG members to mobilise participation to TDWG in their regions and participate in the annual conference and also to become active in the TG and IG.
