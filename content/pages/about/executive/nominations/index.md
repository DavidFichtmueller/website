Nominations are open for positions on the [Executive Committee](../) of Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) for terms spanning 2023-4.

This is an opportunity to lead the development of biodiversity informatics and work with an enthusiastic team to improve the quality and interoperability of biodiversity data.

TDWG is an international organization that promotes the digitization, integration, and sharing of information about the world’s biodiversity. TDWG provides a forum where individuals, projects, and institutions who manage biodiversity data can come together to share expertise and promote interoperability by promulgating standards and best practices. TDWG also publishes the Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS) journal where papers on issues related to information technology and biodiversity science can be published. The TDWG Executive Committee oversees the work of TDWG. It coordinates TDWG's Interest and Task Groups, manages the review and ratification of standards, manages the organization’s journal, and organizes the annual meeting. These responsibilities are set forth in the [Constitution](/about/constitution/) and detailed further in a [supplementary document](../responsibilities/).

Positions on the executive are staggered two-year terms, such that no more than half of the Committee will be new each year. Towards the end of every calendar year, TDWG holds elections for terms that are expiring and need to be filled for the coming year. Officers elected this year will serve terms in the caledar years 2023 and 2024. The the schedule and procedures for nominations and the election are detailed below, followed by open positions, their responsibilities, and nominees.

## Nomination procedure

To nominate someone for one of the positions above, first confirm that the nominee is willing to accept the responsibilities of the office.  Then work with the nominee to send a brief statement of the nominee’s background and vision (maximum 400 words) to the TDWG Secretary ([secretary@tdwg.org](mailto:secretary@tdwg.org)).  Self nominations are accepted.  All nominations must be complete and received before **07 November 2022**.

## Election procedure

The TDWG Secretariat will post the names of nominees below and with links to their statements background and vision.  Shortly after nominations are closed, the Secretariat will distribute ballots to all institutional and individual members in good standing.  In the case of institutional members, we will notify the primary and secondary contacts, but only one ballot response will be accepted. If you are uncertain about your membership status, please inquire with the TDWG Treasurer ([treasurer@tdwg.org](mailto:treasurer@tdwg.org)). Institutional ballots will be weighted as five individual ballots.


## General responsibilities

All officers, including subcommittee chairs, have voting rights on the Executive Committee, and are expected to participate in the Committee’s conference calls, which are generally every two weeks. Executive Committee members are expected to find their own support to attend the annual conference.

## Offices open for election
All serving terms 2023-4, except Deputy Chair, which entails an additional committment of two years as Chair.

### Deputy Chair 

[Responsibilities](../responsibilities/#deputy%20chair). Serves as Deputy Chair 2023-4, then as Chair 2025-6.


### Secretary

[Responsibilities](../responsibilities/#secretary).

#### Nominees:

  - **Visotheary Ung** -- Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris <br /> &nbsp;
    - **_Background:_**  I am a biologist by training, I have a masters degree in population genetics but started my professional career at the CNRS (French national center of scientific research) working as a network and systems administrator for 7 years. In 2007, I came back to my first love in science: Systematics, and in 2008 started to attend TDWG meetings as the scientific communication officer for the Xper research group in Paris. In that role, I had the chance to be involved in European projects (EDIT and ViBRANT) which showed me that collaborative work is the key to success. At the same time, I started a PhD on Southeast Asian biogeography and methodology for comparative biogeography which I defended in 2013. I am now a biodiversity informatics project manager and biogeographer based at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris.  <br /> &nbsp; <br />
I am French and grew up in Paris, but was born in Phnom-Penh (Cambodia). I am very proud of my dual culture, which I see as a richness and I am convinced of its good influence on me. Being part of two different cultures, two different worlds has taught me that it is always possible to build bridges, to bring people together. This is exactly what TDWG is about: to bring together biologists, scientists and developers with the purpose of providing the whole community with standards, best practices and tools.  <br /> &nbsp; <br />
    - **_Vision:_**  My first TDWG meeting was in 2008 in Fremantle and I have not missed one ever since. I am thrilled to be more involved in TDWG activities. As Secretary, I will focus on maintaining good communications within our community: among the Executive committee, members of TDWG Interest and Task Groups and users of TDWG standards. <br /> &nbsp; <br />
I see my role as a connecting hub between everyone, providing clear communication about our processes (creation and use of TDWG standards) and documentation. I have a will to support all members of the Executive committee, especially our chair and hope to be a good proxy. <br /> &nbsp; <br />
I strongly believe that standards are essential to improve biodiversity data sharing and implementing interoperability of software and systems. TDWG standards have been key to my own research and I will continue pushing forward their use within my research community, locally at the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle and on a larger scale to the French scientific community. <br /> &nbsp;

### Technical Architecture Group, Convener

[Responsibilities](/about/committees/tag/#responsibilities)

**Dr. Steve Baskauf, Vanderbilt University Heard Libraries, Nashville, Tennessee, USA**

I have been an active participant in TDWG since 2009 and have served in a variety of leadership roles since then. They include: review manager of Audubon Core, co-convener of the RDF/OWL Task Group, convener of the Vocabulary Maintenance Task Group, current convener of the Audubon Core Maintenance Group, current convener of the Views Controlled Vocabularies Task Group, and member of the Darwin Core Maintenance Group, the Technical Architecture Group (TAG), and others. I was the lead author of the Standards Documentation Specification (SDS), lead author of the Vocabulary Maintenance Specification, lead author of the Darwin Core RDF Guide, lead author of three controlled vocabularies, and co-author of several other standards documents. I am also a major contributor to the development of the TDWG standards maintenance infrastructure (standards metadata and landing pages) and to bringing existing standards documents into conformance with the SDS.

If elected, my first priority would be to refine the organizational and documentation infrastructure to make the TAG the active group envisioned in its charter. There are currently numerous draft standards that are nearing completion, so this is a critical time for the TAG to exert its oversight role. A longer-term priority is to examine the role that feature and implementation experience reporting play in the overall standards development process, and to bring the TDWG Process into line with our aspirational peer standards organizations in this area. To ensure the success of the group, I would leverage the deep knowledge and technical expertise that already exists within TDWG by recruiting core members from across the community.

[Responsibilities](/about/committees/fundraising/#responsibilities)

##### Nominees:

  - **Mareike Petersen** -- Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin <br /> &nbsp;
    - **_Background:_**  For the past eight years, I have been involved in various national and international research projects to improve access to and use of natural science collections. I am interested in advancing data linkage mechanisms and optimizing the management of research and collection data and its open access. I am a biologist by training with a scientific background in herpetology (amphibian ecology and taxonomy). At the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (MfN), I am leading the science data and media management team, work on the mobilization of content to subject-specific and cross-domain portals (e.g. GBIF or Europeana), open access to research data, and on the application and further development of data standards (e.g. in the context of TDWG). Recently, I am strongly involved in the multifaceted information management linked to the digitization project of MfNs’ collections and in the development and establishment of the European research infrastructure DiSSCo (e.g. leading Work package and tasks in DiSSCo Prepare, contributing to Synthesys+). In order to open up information from research processes and information about objects in research collections, to enrich it semantically, and to make it accessible for further use, I bridge the gap between the requirements of research, management of research collections, and the technical implementation by developers. Solving these tasks in an interdisciplinary team is often challenging, but at the same time, it enriches my daily work.  <br /> &nbsp;
    - **_Vision:_**  I am enthusiastic about TDWG complexity and member several Interest and Task Groups and in addition since 2020 Chair of the subcommittee ‘Outreach and Communication’. During the last two years, the subcommittee re-worked TDWGs Vision and Mission Statement in an inclusive process and developed a new logo to increase TDWGs memorability. I would like to further work on a better visibility of TDWG, its standards and their application, importantly also beyond the biodiversity informatics and natural science domain through new communication material and channels. TDWGs’ key messages and achievements need to be transported to stakeholders and potential new user groups around the world, even in in current times, where travelling and meetings in person are limited or impossible at all.

<!-- Term: 2022-23 
### Time and Place, Chair  

[Responsibilities](/about/committees/tardis/#responsibilities)

**Dr. Patricia Mergen, Botanical Garden, Meise; Royal Museum of Central Africa, Tervuren, Belgium**

As a member of the Association of International Associations based in Belgium and many contacts with the "Meet in" or "visit" or "Tourism" (town, country) I am happy to have TDWG continue to benefit from those connections to find support for venues. Additionally the contacts with the local scientific, technical potential hosts is very important within our network.

If elected, I would continue to act as a relay between potential hosts and TDWG Executive. The goal remains to have venues identified on a 3 to 5 years horizon. I would also continue to push regional representatives to play a bigger role in this committee and other TDWG members to mobilise participation to TDWG in their regions and participate in the annual conference and also to become active in the TG and IG.

### Regional Representatives

[Responsibilities](/about/executive/responsibilities/#regional%20representatives)

#### Regional Representative for Africa  
<!-- Term: 2023-4 -->

##### Nominees:

  - **Ian Englebrecht** -- Natural Science Collections Facility, South Africa <br /> &nbsp;
    - **_Background:_** I am currently employed with the Natural Science Collections Facility (nscf.org.za) in a capacity to coordinate digitization of museum and herbarium collections in South Africa, as well as driving skills development for biodiversity informatics within this community. My primary training is as a conservation biologist and arachnologist. I have a special interest in taxonomy of scorpions and mygalomorph spiders, and completed my PhD in 2015 through the University of Pretoria. I have a long standing interest in information systems and how they support decision making and knowledge management, and studied programming part time early in my career.  I have worked in museum institutions, government conservation agencies, and the private sector. I currently participate in the TDWG Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) meetings with an interest in APIs and identifiers. I especially enjoy developing software tools and utilities to aid with data management tasks, and teaching others to do the same. <br /> &nbsp;
    - **_Vision:_** My vision is a vibrant African specimen collections digitization and biodiversity informatics community that shares and publishes data willingly and openly. Skills and capacity development are in my view the most important priorities for achieving this vision. I see participation in TDWG events, as well as others such as the iDigBio events, as an essential part of this capacity development process, and would value the opportunity to play a role in broadening participation and interest in TDWG activities within the wider African community. I also hope that my experience and technical background would bring some value to the TDWG Executive Committee in achieving its goals and objectives. <br /> &nbsp;


#### Regional Representative for Europe  
<!-- Term: 2023-4 -->
##### Nominees
  - **Laurence Livermore** -- The Natural History Museum, London <br />&nbsp;
    - **_Background:_**  I am passionate about open data and increasing collaboration and community building to enable better data mobilisation from natural history collections. I have been working on community projects in Europe for over ten years, including two iterations of the EC-funded SYNTHESYS projects, ICEDIG, DiSSCo Prepare and Mobilise projects. Recently, this has included the proposal writing and leading the collaborative development of [Specimen Data Refinery platform](https://github.com/DiSSCo/SDR) in SYNTHESYS+ and the managing the creation of Digitisation Guides for [DiSSCo Prepare]( https://dissco.github.io/). <br /> &nbsp; <br />
    I am an active participant in SPNHC and CETAF (especially the Digitisation Working Group), and intend to remain active during my potential tenure. I have extensive experience of collaboration outside of Europe, including delivering e-taxonomy training in four continents, delivering a GBIF BID workshop in Jamaica, and digitisation of Malaysian collections as part of national digitisation initiative. I attended my first TDWG conference in 2014 ([slides](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1219251.v1)), and have attended all in-person European conferences since ([2019](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.10024715.v1) and [2022](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21312345.v1)). Both myself and my digitisation team use TDWG standards on a day-to-day basis in our projects and are keen to give more user feedback on implementation and use. <br /> <br />
    I am an experienced editor of formal publications (Zootaxa, [ZooKeys](https://zookeys.pensoft.net/browse_journal_groups.php?journal_id=2&role_id=3&user_letter=L), [BDJ](https://bdj.pensoft.net/board/)) and for [special collections](https://riojournal.com/topical_collection/84). For examples of community presentations and outreach see my [Figshare profile](https://figshare.com/authors/Laurence_Livermore/100501). <br /> &nbsp; <br />
    - **_Vision:_** There are multiple exciting initiatives across Europe which will benefit from global connectivity, including the continued development of DiSSCo and the establishment of national DiSSCo nodes. <br /> &nbsp; <br />
    As Regional Representative for Europe, I would maintain and strengthen connections between the other regional representatives and promote TDWG's role in developing and promoting the use of biodiversity data standards. DiSSCo, and related initiatives around the world (e.g., GBIFs regional programmes, iDigBio, and ALA), are more effective and efficient when they collaborate and share approaches. Our community still has more to gain from establishing more shared practices, protocols, and training programmes. I would like to promote the co-development of more regional initiatives, or at least help connect people and initiatives that have the potential to benefit by working together. <br /> &nbsp; <br />
    I am keen to promote wider participation in SPNHC and will ensure TDWG's work is brought to CETAF's Digitisation Working Group and Information Science and Technology Committee. Over the next two years I will be working to develop the DiSSCo-UK node and want to ensure that our work benefits the wider community, that we implement TDWG standards, and encourage wider participation in TDWG activities. <br />

#### Regional Representative for Latin America  
<!-- Term: 2023-4 -->
##### Nominees:
  - **Paula Zermoglio** -- VertNet, Bariloche, Argentina <br /> &nbsp;
    - **_Background:_**  I am a biologist, and my scientific background is in insect ecology and physiology. I got my masters degree in biological sciences at the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina), and a dual PhD in biological sciences at the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina) and the University of Tours (France). For the last ten years, aside from my scientific research activities, I have been involved in biodiversity informatics. My first steps were at the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales, first as an intern and then coordinator of a collections digitization initiative. Back then, realizing the importance and necessity of data sharing using standards, pushed me to get involved in the biodiversity informatics community. I had a lot to learn (still have!), but more importantly, I had a will to share what I was learning. Since then, I have participated in data mobilization initiatives and I have provided training on data mobilization, data standards, data quality and georeferencing, nationally and internationally. I am currently part of the VertNet team and I have been involved with the GBIF community in mentoring and capacity building in Africa, Europe, South America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific regions. In the last years I have been increasingly involved in the biodiversity data standards community. Currently, at TDWG, I am a member of the Data Quality Interest Group, where I convene the “Vocabularies” task group (officially “Best practices for development of vocabularies of values”), and of the Darwin Core Maintenance Interest Group.<br /> &nbsp;<br />
    - **_Vision:_**  I firmly believe that progress towards better standards and their better use depends on a two-way relationship: TDWG reaching out to the broad community and the community reaching out to TDWG. <br /> &nbsp;<br />
    As TDWG Latin America representative, my focus will be on closing the gap between TDWG and the local community, fomenting TDWG adoption of regional-friendly approaches, encouraging greater participation of the region in the development and enhancement of TDWG standards and promoting their use. My approach will be centered on improving communication between regional stakeholders and TDWG. For instance, considering the diversity of backgrounds, understanding and needs in the region, I will create opportunities for the region to engage with TDWG by fostering dissemination of TDWG contents in the local languages. <br /> &nbsp;<br />
    More broadly, as member of the Executive, I will work towards a better integration of TDWG standards across the global community, both from the technical and the social points of view. 

#### Regional Representative for North America  
<!-- Term: 2023-4 -->
##### Nominees

  - **Chandra Earl** -- Bishop Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii <br /> &nbsp;
    - **_Background:_**  Chandra received her PhD from the University of Florida where her work bridged many facets of informatics and data science, with a focus on large-scale biodiversity informatics. She is currently applying these skills to Pacific Island biodiversity, primarily making these data research-grade and available to data aggregators and island researchers. She was an active member of the TDWG 2022 Conference Program Committee and was integral to the success of the hybrid meeting.  She has already expressed a keen interest in being involved with the planning of TDWG 2023 hosted in Tasmania and TDWG 2024 in Okinawa. Her current location in Hawaii provides an important geographical linkage between the Asia-Pacific, Oceania and North America.  <br /> &nbsp;
    - **_Vision:_**  If elected as Regional Representative, her vision will be focused on greater representation within early career researchers, students and those researching relatively understudied taxonomic groups across North America. While DarwinCore (and by extension the TDWG community) is well known within the museum and digitization communities, there are many who have unique use cases that may be overlooked due to taxonomic biases in funding. She would also like to focus on a greater awareness of TDWG within younger researchers and providing clear benefits for entry into the community. <br /> &nbsp;

<!-- 2022-23 
#### Regional Representative for Oceania 

  - **Dr. Shelley James, Western Australian Herbarium**

Dr Shelley James is the Collections Manager of the Western Australian Herbarium, based in Kensington, Western Australia. She has been acting as the Regional Representative for Oceania for the past six months, and is part of the TDWG 2021 Program Committee.  Shelley has been assisting with the planning for the TDWG 2024 meeting in her position as Member at Large on the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC)  Council, and looks forward to continuing to help with planning.  Shelley has been an active participant and member of TDWG for more than 10 years.  Her recent work is focused on the expansion and improvement of herbarium collections and biodiversity data and ways to best analyze, contribute to, understand, and better our conservation efforts. She collaborates nationally and internationally with collections, research, cyberinfrastructure, and education communities. With her experience working in Australasia, Melanesia and the Pacific, she is well placed to communicate the biodiversity data standards activities being undertaken across the globe as the TDWG Oceania Regional Representative.
