# The Program Committee for TDWG 2021

Meeting regularly on Zoom, Slack, and collaborating on Google Drive throughout 2021 from all over the world, the #TDWG2021PrgmCmte is fueled by volunteers who have called for session organizers; solicited, reviewed, and edited abstracts; explored spaces for virtual social networking; and worked on scheduling events. Some wear multiple hats; some are veterans of conference planning, others are new to the process, but all learn something new, have the chance to take a leadership role on a team, and to meet and work with new colleagues and friends.
