# TDWG 2022
# 17–21 October


_Last updated 12 September 2022_

<!-- Translations: ES, FR, JP -->

The Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) annual conference in 2022 will be a hybrid meeting, hosted in Sofia, Bulgaria.

**Stronger together - in person or online!  #tdwg2022**

Although pandemic restrictions appear to be waning in many countries, we expect that many organizations will still be limiting professional travel in the fall of 2022. Consequently, TDWG 2022 will be a hybrid conference; in-person for those who can travel, and virtual for those who cannot. The conference will accommodate symposia, workshops, contributed oral and poster presentations, demos, and discussions, as well as keynotes and social events. Session timing will be anchored to the working hours of Sofia, Bulgaria, where the in-person conference will be held. (UTC+3; EEST during the conference.) Sessions will be streamed live via Zoom, as well as recorded and posted for people participating remotely (registration required). 

**Update:** Conference notifications will be distributed to registrants via MailChimp.

Registration costs differ for in-person or virtual participation. As in past years, registration fees include a discount structure, and help to defray the cost of abstract publication. Special discounts are in place for students, post-docs or early career researchers, and participants from [low/low-middle income nations](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups). You can even donate funds to support registration of those in need.  Check out the link above for full details. When you are ready, use the button there to complete your registration.

**All session organizers and _presenters_ at TDWG 2022 must be registered.** If you are listed as a presenter on an [abstract](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/384/) for the conference, you must be registered before your abstract will be published. Please do this as soon as possible so that we can create the program.  If you are unsure whether you will attend in person or virtually, there is no penalty for registering for virtual participation and later upgrading to in-person status. There is a penalty (after 17 August) for downgrading registration (see [Terms & Conditions on registration link](https://events.pensoft.net/events/tdwg-2022-hybrid-conference)).

If the cost of registration is a barrier to your participation in this conference, please contact [conf-organizers@tdwg.org](mailto:conf-organizers@tdwg.org) and briefly state why this is a barrier.
