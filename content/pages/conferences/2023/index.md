### About the Conference

Head south of the equator in 2023 to Hobart, Tasmania for the TDWG 2023 Conference! ALA and NRCA welcome you to Australia!

Situated on the Hobart waterfront, home to the finishers of the annual Sydney to Hobart Regatta, the Hobart Conference Center is the ideal place to interact in person with colleagues about biodiversity data standards, or remotely if you are unable to travel. TDWG 2023 will again be a hybrid conference, encouraging our diverse community to engage and promote the important work of Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG).
