title: Audiovisual Core Multimedia Resources Metadata Schema
description: >
  The Audiovisual Core (AC) is a set of vocabularies designed to represent metadata for biodiversity multimedia resources and collections. These vocabularies aim to represent information that will help to determine whether a particular resource or collection will be fit for some particular biodiversity science application before acquiring the media. Among others, the vocabularies address such concerns as the management of the media and collections, descriptions of their content, their taxonomic, geographic, and temporal coverage, and the appropriate ways to retrieve, attribute and reproduce them.

## Maintenance group

Audiovisual Core is maintained by a specialized [Interest Group](/community/ac/) whose [charter](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/audubon-core_maintenance-group_charter.md) was approved in January 2018. The functions of the Audiovisual Core Maintenance Group are described in detail in [Section 2 of the TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md#2-administration). In brief, the Maintenance Group manages vocabulary term additions and changes, and maintains the documentation that helps users to understand and apply the standard. As an Interest Group, it may establish Task Groups to accomplish broader changes to the standard.

The activities of the AC Maintenance Group are documented at the group's Github repository, <https://github.com/tdwg/ac>, where a current list of core members and their contact information can be found. Community participation is welcome. If you would like to participate in this group, contact the convener or one of the core members.

To participate in the communications of the group, "watch" the group's [Issues tracker](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues). This issues tracker is the mechanism for suggesting specific changes to the standard as well as to raise issues for discussion by the group.

## Parts of the standard

This standard is comprised of 6 vocabularies and 9 documents.

Vocabularies:

- Audiovisual Core main vocabulary (<http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/>)
- variant controlled vocabulary (<http://rs.tdwg.org/acvariant/>)
- format controlled vocabulary (<http://rs.tdwg.org/format/>)
- subtype controlled vocabulary (<http://rs.tdwg.org/acsubtype/>)
- subjectOrientation controlled vocabulary (<http://rs.tdwg.org/acorient/>)
- subjectPart controlled vocabulary (<http://rs.tdwg.org/acpart/>)

Abstract
: The Audiovisual Core is a set of vocabularies designed to represent metadata for biodiversity multimedia resources and collections. It aims to represent information that will help to determine whether a particular resource or collection will be fit for some particular biodiversity science application before acquiring the media. Among others, the vocabularies address such concerns as the management of the media and collections, descriptions of their content, their taxonomic, geographic, and temporal coverage, and the appropriate ways to retrieve, attribute and reproduce them. This document contains a list of attributes of each Audiovisual Core term, including a documentation name, a specified URI, a recommended English label for user interfaces, a definition, and some ancillary notes. This document contains normative content that may not be changed without due process.

Abstract
: The Audiovisual Core term `subjectOrientation` describes the viewing orientation relative to an organism or part of an organism depicted in a media item or region of interest. The `subjectOrientation` Controlled Vocabulary provides terms that should be used as values for `ac:subjectOrientation` and its literal-valued analog `ac:subjectOrientationLiteral`.

Abstract
