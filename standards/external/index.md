The standards listed on this page were ratified as TDWG standards prior to the adoption of the [current standards development process](/about/process/) in 2006. Although TDWG no longer has any role in maintaining them, TDWG still recommends their use, even though they may not qualify as Current Standards under the present-day documentation and maintenance criteria.
