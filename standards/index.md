TDWG standards have a [status and category]({filename}status-and-categories/index.md). Current standards and those under consideration as Draft standards are governed by the [TDWG Process](https://tdwg.org/about/process/), which includes the appointment of a [Review Manager](https://www.tdwg.org/about/review-managers/) to oversee expert and public review of TDWG standards. Our standards are also available as a collection on [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/collection/TDWGBiodiversity), which places them in context with databases that implement them and data policies that endorse their use.
