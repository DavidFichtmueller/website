TDWG standards have a [status and category](/standards/status-and-categories/). Current standards and those under consideration as Draft standards are governed by the [TDWG Process](/about/process/), which includes the appointment of a [Review Manager](/about/review-managers/) to oversee expert and public review of TDWG standards. Our standards are also available as a collection on [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/collection/TDWGBiodiversity), which places them in context with databases that implement them and data policies that endorse their use.
